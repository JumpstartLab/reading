# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Mark Tabler, Elise Worthy, Andrew Thal, Daniel Kaufman

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?"

- It does not mesh with those ideas because people are being extrinsically rewarded for their work, and that work is technically supposed to be "play".

- It's clear that these companies are not promoting open source for the betterment of the community but because it gives them some sort of return.

#### B: "What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?"

- Clear goals and clear, severe, consequences for not meeting the goals. Adequate pay.

- In a ROWE, those people without intrinsic motivation, who are just trying to get through the day, will bottom out their performance.

- It may be inappropriate for industries where your work is, by definition, tied to time or when employees do not have direct control over your output.

- A ROWE team would need clear goals and clear, severe, consequences for not meeting the goals, in addition to adequate pay.

#### C: "If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?"

- Only so much bandwidth - cooking is taking a back seat to programming at the moment. When the bandwidth is there, we do pursue mastery in our passions. There are some things in life we want to do more that aren't masterable (like travel).

- We pursue things that bring us joy. We had a hard time figuring out what makes us happy about one thing over another, but we agree that we pursue the things that do make us happiest when we have the time to devote.

#### D: "In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?"

- Following: There's a little autonomy for us through open source and ability to do different extensions, etc.

- Now, that reward for lightning talks for the first week was very Drive, however the second week was not.

- Not following: All the intrinsic motivation for reading Drive got sucked out by the extrinsic motivatiors of the point system and the time-sensititity. We loved the idea behind the book, but had to analyze it for the specific things we'd be judged on - quotes, etc, which made it less exciting.

- Not a lot of autonomy in reading: the reading is the worst part and is the least following of the Drive principles. The structure of the exercise (and the choice of the books) makes it not enjoyable.

- Some of our projects could be more purposeful - but we understand that our first sets of code aren't that great.

- We would love to know what level of mastery we're actually at: testing what we've learned, not prescriptively.
