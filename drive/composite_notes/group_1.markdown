# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Mike, Tom, Melanie, Mary

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?"

Companies are into Motivation 3.0 and recognizing people who are doing cool things and innovating.

OSS projects develop a lot faster because so many people are working on them.

Open source is creating something intrinsic value --  when you are working on OSS you have purpose and motivation.

#### B: "What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?"

Some individuals would fail in this of work environment. The lack of structure sometimes is to much for some time of people to self regulate themselves. 

While building things together in a team it is hard because then individuals will go off on their own and the rest of the group will be lost.

Medical field could suffer without hands off requirement.  Restaurant services (wait-staff, bus-boys, chefs).  What would ROWE look like with an assistant.

#### C: "If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?"

Mary: contemporary arts (art appreciation/scholarship), prevented by cost of schooling, opening gallery, etc.

Melanie: running, easily deterred from mastery, injuries, hard to start from scratch every time.

Mike: snowboarding.  injuries, lack of skill.

Tom: Photography/Cinematography. lack of time in the day, too many distractions with every day life to set aside the time outside of work and life to get better.

#### D: In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?

Everyone is given same set of problems - but take own route to get there. 

ROWE environment, but only sort of. We do have scheduled class time. 

People come in on the weekends, and work from home. 

Provided with "distractions" to increase productivity -- can switch between tasks to "wake up" the brain.
