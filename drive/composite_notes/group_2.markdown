# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group 2

Group members: A = Chris Anderson, B = Ed Weng, C = Nisarg Shah, D = Horace Williams

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?"

For some smaller companies like Engine Yard, having the major brain trust like Evan brings the firm prominence and publicity, but it doesn't work quite the same at a large company like AT&T. Though it can be tricky if someone works at a smaller company (like Evan) but isn't forced to do things that actually benefit the company on a direct level. It's really unique and would only work at a few companies.

#### B: "What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?"

Some downsides to operating a ROWE: difficult mindset to get into, there will be an initial phase that might lack productivity, and there is a large danger in people abusing the system. Additionally, people might view ROWE as a way to only accomplish what is expected of them. 

ROWE likely would not work for a lot of service-oriented industries where extensive face-to-face interaction is required (e.g. restaurants, trading houses). Additionally, team-based activities that couldn't be accomplished by individual people would be difficult in a ROWE (e.g. architect firms).

A ROWE team needs self-sufficient individuals who are reasonably motivated, who are working on projects with parts that can be clearly segmented.

#### If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?

Mastery of:
- Water coloring
- Piano
- Foreign Language & english
- screen writing

Stops you:
- Desire (just do it for fun)
- Time
- Non-clear path
- resources (ex/ community)

Put your group's response/ideas here.

#### D: "In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?"

#####What IS Motivation 3.0:
* Project assignments are more ROWE-y. We mostly have the freedom to schedule our work time as necessary with our partner.
* Not much in the way of Carrots/sticks
* Trust serves as a huge motivator among a group of people (at least one like this)
* Baseline compensation/living maintenance is very well taken care of - this definitely has the effect Pink describes (we don't have to worry about it)

#####What IS NOT Motivation 3.0:
* 9 AM Start Time What?
* Seems to be an example of when ROWE would fail (classroom time/training - people need to be together as a group)
* Point systems as motivator - help to get us to do stuff we wouldn't otherwise want to do.
* Jobs at the end of the program -  the biggest carrot of all

#####Other Q's:
* What would "true ROWE" look like at Hungry Academy?
* Where do you draw the line between ROWE/Not-ROWE? What is the grey area? (Pink tends to focus on the most extreme examples)
