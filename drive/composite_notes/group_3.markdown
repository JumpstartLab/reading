# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Christopher Maddox, Jan Koszewski, Travis Valentine, Jacqueline Chenault

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?"

Jan: you have to have basic needs met in order for people to 
JQ: it's allowing for mastery
Jan: and autonomy
Chris: gives them a sense of purpose, helping other people do stuff better
JQ: how does it affect the companies themselves?
Chris: EngineYard for example gets a lot out of it - they are better for their staff doing OSS. for a co like ATT, there are more people involved and interested
JQ: stupid AT&T
Travis: Does there need to be a balance?
Chris: I wonder what it does to them about drive. The reason people did OSS was to give back, but that's their job. How does that shift their motivation?
JQ: But are people paid in their free-time writing articles (re: Wikipedia)?
Chris: I would think people who are paid to work for a company like Wikipedia or open source, they'd do it anyway. Money isn't the motivator for them.
Jan: Back to the point about motivation, after you reach critical mass with an OSS program, I'd think you have to have institutional support for that program. Otherwise where does the program go? I don't know if there's an example of a product that doesn't exist without a core team behind it? The entire economic model of things being worked on for free kind of falls apart.
Chris: there's a difference between a cost of doing something and doing something for pay, but the work being done is pretty much for free. motivation doesn't dictate how an organization is structured
JQ: How do you ensure that if you're working on an OSS project that there will be support there to keep it up?
Chris: Just supply and demand. If it matters, people will support it. AT&T invests in it because there is a benefit. There is a clear value add.
Jan: And once you reach that moment, it will become self-sustaining.

#### B: "What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?"

JQ: if it's results only, how do you determine what the proper worload is?
CM: It depends on whether or not other people can do it
TV: depends on what everyone is capable of, measure it based off of that
JQ: is there room for growth in that environment?
CM: sure you do the most with the least amount of resources
JQ: so the people who can't compete at a higher level are screwed?
CM: yes - i wouldn't hire people who suck
TV: the process will inherently be self-selecting
CM: if people love what they're doing, they'll do it anyway.  you can have people doing what they love in 5 hours vs. 12 hours, but it doesn't matter overall if the work gets done
JQ: at some point it does matter as far as when the work gets done if you're trying to meet a goal
CM: it'll happen anyway
CM: there are a lot of ethical concerns with letting people do absolutely anything to achieve their ends, e.g., investment banking
TV: exactly, the guy who was gaming the entire system behind the housing market, who knew exactly what he was doing to crash the system
CM: it's where there are externalities behind their own self
TV: what if the purpose is just to make a shitton of money for your clients?  e.g., where the mission drives results for just making money
JK: does capitalism mesh well with ROWE then?
JQ: well, if your purpose is just to make money, then yeah, that will BE your purpose - there can be type I investment bankers - they can be involved in the give and take, and that can be in good faith and service to their clients.  if this is what people really love and want to do, they'll do it
CM: I think the point is that that isn't exactly true - there is a baseline level of happiness, and the marginal utility of making more money doesn't actually end up making you happier.  to the point of capitalism, the idea that if you purely pursue profit people will inherently be ethical, people will gain socially by being less profit-oriented

#### C: "If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?"

Jan:Flying (I'm kidding)
TV: I'd like to make my own furniture. It's ridiculously expensive. The table we're at is expensive.
Jan: Cooking. Time keeps me from it.
Group: Yeah, time's going to be a common theme.
Jan: I'd like to be better at crossfit and there are some skills that I'd like to hone and if you want to build skills and strength it's hard.
Chris: What is crossfit?
(description of crossfit workouts etc)
Chris: So we could find you 20 minutes in a day.
Jan: But the trouble is if you really want to get good the top people do 8 workouts a day. There was a time at mt last job I was pulling two a day but I had the time because I wasn't doing much at my former job
Chris: I'd like to do cooking - it's the kind of thing you could do for yourself and for other people, too. Hungry Academy dinner parties. Cooking for other people, building furniture. I feel like we've kind of lost that, making things.
Jan: There is a huge intrinsic war against making things with your hands.
JQ: One of the coolest things about the renaissance faire is that everything there is handmade.
Jan: I respected the shit out of larpers because they could make a foam sword.
TV: You kind of have to respect anyone who is really good at something
Chris: I kind of respect anyone who is good at things. Even if I'm not intrested in it.
Jan: Except for murder.
JQ: Mine would be theatre and acting.
Chris: I feel like I'm that way with Git and frontend. I just know I can't match colors, I can't make pretty shapes but I respect the shit out of people who can make that happen.
Jan: Karate. I'm not sure I'd want to learn karate. All the yelling. Not my style.
JQ: You need to do tai chi. Less yelling. More flow.

#### D: "In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?"

Jan: Lightening Talks, we are falling short
JQ: autonomy, we don't really have autonomy. The places where we don't have it are where a teaching environment is necessary.
T: By the end of it I feel like we'll fall into a natural groove and be more in touch with what the book's talking about.
JQ: The lecture isn't an environment where you can balance an extra hour of sleep over doing it later. If you had that video library somewhere, I could rest and get healthy and learn it later. At what point can you start giving that autonomy?
T: One-on-ones, when we ask for feedback and don't get any... In a sense, because we're supposed to identify where we can improve, it makes sense.
Chris: I feel like since they have the ability to step back and see us work, while I respect that we are given the responsibility to understand it myself, I'd like more feedback.
Jan: Do you think the people who are following along are on an equal level in terms of purpose of where we are?
JQ: I think they are more purpose motivated since we are getting paid.
Jan: I had no mobility at my own job, and was shot down on every level, which makes it hard for me to believe that things can change in every environment.
JQ: you have to find the happy medium between giving your employees leeway to give the crazy amazing customer service.
T: How do you make that job enjoyable? They're not given any freedom to make their lives any better.
JQ: The sales people do have commissions, but if you talk about it in your interview you won't get the job because they don't want people who only care about that.
