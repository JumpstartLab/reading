# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Michael, Charles, Jonan, Andy

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?"

I guess it meshes because bleeple bopple frizzle frazzle. - Charles Strahan
Oh, and those Rockstars aren't paid like, um... Rockstars. It's passion that drives them, the money just makes it convenient to do it all day.

I'm guessing that what they're getting paid for their OS contributions isn't substantial, that's just a guess, it's just a motivator. - Michael Verdi

But they're employed full-time. - Andy Glass

There are benefits to paying people to work on the frameworks full time, if you need a performance improvement they can implement it. 

#### B: "What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?"
Customer service as an example of an inappropriate category.

Enabled by the internet and telecommuting.

If you have mastery, autonomy and purpose in a position- ROWE makes sense.  If not, it will not work.

#### C: "If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?"
Master of Business - and excellent leader that inspires the masses to do be greater.
Languages - Jonan would like to know 7 languages before he dies 
Andrew - Chessboxing because he wants to assert you intelligence and physical abilities
Charles - the question is not applicaable because I know everything I want already.  I am a master of all.


#### D: "In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?"
Pro:

* Took money off the table.
* Autonomy along the path to mastery.
* Results oriented, instead of process oriented.

Con:

* THE BOOKS!
