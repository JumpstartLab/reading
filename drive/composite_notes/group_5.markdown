# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Michael Chlipala, Austen Ito, Conan Rimmer, Darrel Rivera

### Discussion Summary

#### A: The Ruby community has around a dozen people who are paid to work on Open Source Software full-time by companies like AT&T and Engine Yard. How does that mesh with the ideas of Drive and of OSS itself?

* It may run counter to the ideals of OSS. It's also interesting that some of these key players have recently stepped down to pursue other projects/jobs (effectively relegating their future contributions only to their "spare time").

* Perhaps it's an inevitable route that OSS software takes? Organizations are a good body to subsidize OSS contributions, and organizations may want to see this stuff succeed.

* Organizations may not care if it's open source or not, they're just using it because it's the best piece of software. This is strictly a business decision to employ these individuals. In the example of consulting companies, they're selling their team and expertise; amassing a very talented group of OS contributors is likely a selling point when winning new business.

#### B: What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?

* What downsides would you expect in a purely Results-Only Work Environment? 

There is a greater potential for abuse
People taking shortcuts
It's hard to manage less tangible output. 
It may create busy work to prove what you were working on 
It's much harder to find people. Some people need structure or else they might 
fail

* What industries or categories of work does it seem inappropriate for? 

Factories
Environments where there is mundane work
Motivation 2.0 work. (i.e Accounting)
Where the amount of time worked is proportianal to production.
Non-creative, algorithmic tasks.

* What factors would a ROWE team need to succeed?

Clearly defined goals
Type I personalities (People that succeed when there are few boundaries) 
Time, team, technique, task, and tools
An environment with a high degree of trust and autonomy

#### C: If tomorrow you could wake up as a master of one thing other than programming, what would it be? Why? What stops you from developing mastery now?

###Mike C.
1) play music
2) personal enjoyment
3) no free time to pursue it, focus on one thing at a time

###Conan R.
1) play cello or guitar
2) personal enjoyment
3) no free time to pursue it, larger priorities, not practical

### Darrell R.
1) cooking
2) personal enjoyment
3) no free time to pursue it

###Austen I.
1) wine (sommelier)
2) personal enjoyment
3) too much money ($20k to build palette/taste all wine for master test), too little time (lots of wine testing; lots of facts to memorize)

#### D: In what ways has Hungry Academy followed the prescriptions in Drive? In what ways is it falling short?

Follow:
* We are compensated well to not worry about money
* No set number of spots at the end so gets rid of competition
* Freedom of how you structure day outside of class
* Given goal but can choose how to get there
* "Do as best as you can" and bonus can be a job
* Purpose is the sole of this program --> it was a risk to come here so we try to encourage each other to succeed

Falling Short:
* Mastery piece might not be achieved since we are surfacing different subjects (we are not specializing on a specific subject)
* Still some managerial control that is exerted (i.e., we can't choose our own groups)
* There's a pretty big carrot at the end of the program.
