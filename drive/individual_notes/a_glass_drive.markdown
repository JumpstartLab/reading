Andy Glass "Drive" Hungry Academy Reading

Introduction

A)"Pay for performance may not take us as far as we thought... we have deeper motivations #moneydoesnt buy happiness #justjetskis"

B)"Human beings, Deci said, have an "inheirit tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise their capacities, to explore and to learn"

C) I dont see why it's surprising that in Deci's experiment, people became more interested when being paid and then less interested when no longer being paid.  You won't get someone at Subway to make subs when they are off the clock.


Chapter 1

A)"Behavioral Economics seem awesome. I need to read predictably Irrational. #imnotawealthmaximizingrobot"

B)"We hang on to bad investments for longer than we should, because we feel sharper pain from losing money than we do from gaining the same exact amount"

C) It shocking to hear the claim that behavioral studies are being ignored- as there is an incredible amount of value in getting people to work to their potential


Chapter 2

A)"contingent rewards kill drive, good behavior and creativity #implicationsforprostitutes?"

B)"rewards can perform a wierd sort of behavorial alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge"

C) I don't like how Pink lumps all 'Carrot' incentives in the same boat.  What about stock-based compensation?  What about alternate forms (i.e. if you are a top performer, you get more freedoms/privledges, etc)


Chapter 2a

A)"Carrots kill work performance, unless that work is routine and boring...like peeling carrots #peelersshouldstrike"

B)"Rewards do not undermine people's intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is little or no intrinsic motivation to be undermined"

C) I am really starting to hate how Pink unveils the new results to studies mentioned in previous chapters


Chapter 3

A)"cardiologist describing people prone to heart attack: execessive competitive drive, aggressiveness, impatience, time urgency.  #FUCK"

B)"What you haven't done is the hard work of diagnosing what the problem is.  You're trying to run over the problem with a carrot or stick"

C) How can you develop Type I personalities in a work environment with boring and menial work?  Is this possible?



Chapter 4

A)"ROWE is the way of the future for motivation. I thrive with autonomy and think most others will as well #treatpeoplelikeadults"

B)"Management isnt about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices.  Its about creating conditions for people to do their best work"

C) I loved this chapter, but I think Pink seems to overlook the potential consequences of making employees business owners.  It can certainly be a risky proposition.



Chapter 5

A)"Being in flow is working without knowing you're working. It's engaging in a task because you find it satisfying and challenging.  #mastery"

B)"Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life.  Effort means you care about something, that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it.  It would be an impoversihed existance if you were not willing to value things and commit yourself to working towards them"
Dr. J - "Being a professional, is doing the things you love to do, on the days you dont feel like doing them"
C) I love the theories that the companies Pink cites are implementing, but it must be incredibly difficult to hire correctly for these positions.  Like Hungry Academy, they must seek highly motivated individuals who 'live hungry'.  As LivingSocial knows, this is a large effort.



Chapter 6

A)"Pink nailed 'purpose' for me. If I don't jive with the greater purpose of my work, I won't care.  If I can, I'd bleed for my company"

B)"Spend a little less time telling how and a little more time showing why"

C) Slight objection to Deci's study re: recent graduates' happiness compared to their fulfillment of profit and purpose goals.  I tend to think a recent grad (3 years out) would not really have a true knowledge of whether they were on track to attain such goals.  


9 Strategies for awakening your motivation

A)"Taking a stab at my sentence: He helped people live better by reaching their potential"

B)"As you contemplate your purpose, ask the big question: what is your sentence"
"Was I alittle better today than yesterday"

C) I wonder what I'd have to put on my 'dont do' list.



13 ways to improve your company, office or group

A)"Type X bosses relish control.  Type I bosses relinquish control #damnIhatemyoldcompany"

B)"Everyone wants autonomy, mastery and purpose.  The thing is, 'we' can get them but 'they' cant"

C) Definately agree with Pink's disdain for performance review, but not sure his monthly goals idea is perfected.  I think this concept is similar to Rypple (which I like) mixed in with more peer-involvement to encourage accountability and over a longer time period.


The Zen of Compensation

A)"Salespeople respond to commissions? Redgate software saw sales increase after ousting commissions #incredible"

B)"Zen of compensation: The best use of money is to take the issue of money off the table"

C) I was surprised Pink didn't come back to the topic of alternate compensation.  How do people respond to having daycare provided for their kids, a barber on staff, or fun company-wide engagement?  I think these are interesting techniques to keep employees happy.



10 Ideas for helping our kids

A)"Pink should raise my children. Let them find and explore their passions rather then learn to follow orders"

B)"This sends kids  a clear (and clearly wrongheaded) message: In the absence of payment, no self-respecting child would willingly set the table, empty the garbage or make her own bed"

C) Love the concept of a "DIY" report card, but I dont think traditional metrics of success for kids in school here can be 100% replaced (even though they really do suck).  It is important to know what kids love and hate, but also important to have some sort of benchmark of their learning.




15 essential books


A)"Book on Pink's list I'd like to read most: Maverick: The Success Story Behind the world's most unusual workplace #intrigued"

B)"I want everyone at Semco to be self-sufficient.  The company is organized not to depend too much on any individual- especially me"

C) Nothing to object on from a book list



7 Business thinkers who get it

A)"Thinked I'd most like to go to dinner with:  Jim Collins. Why: he seem's like a masterful motivator. I would love to learn from a person who gets people on his bus"

B)"lead with questions, not answers. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.  Conduct autopsies, without blame.  Build 'red flag' mechanisms...make it easy for employees and customers to speak up when they identify a problem "

C) Nothing to really object on this list either



4 Tips for getting and staying motivated to exercise

A) "Agree with Pink in the importance of setting your own fitness goals.  That should be able you, and you should sets your sights and hold yourself accountable"

B)"By continually increasing the difficulty of the challenges you take on and setting more audacious challenges for yourself as time passes, you can renew that energy and stay motivated"

C) Nothing really to object on here, other than the fact that this section could have probably been omitted from the book
