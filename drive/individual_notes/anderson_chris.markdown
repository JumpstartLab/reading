# Chapter 1

"Carrot and stick" is outmoded. Incompatible with new business models and modern economics. Need new ways of thinking.

"TO RECAP, "Motivation 2.0 suffers from three compatibility problems. It doesn’t mesh with the way many new business models are organizing what we do—because we’re intrinsically motivated purpose maximizers, not only extrinsically motivated profit maximizers. It doesn’t comport with the way that twenty-first-century economics thinks about what we do—because economists are finally realizing that we’re full-fledged human beings, not single-minded economic robots. And perhaps most important, it’s hard to reconcile with much of what we actually do at work—because for growing numbers of people, work is often creative, interesting, and self-directed rather than unrelentingly routine, boring, and other-directed."

What's the line between helpful and unhelpful rewards? Can this model be applied to all businesses?

# Chapter 2

Rewards harm motivation, creativity, humanitarianism. Goals cause ethics lapses, short-term focus.

"The fine shifted the parents’ decision from a partly moral obligation (be fair to my kids’ teachers) to a pure transaction (I can buy extra time). There wasn’t room for both. The punishment didn’t promote good behavior; it crowded it out."

While there's obviously a lot of evidence, this cut and dryness seems a bit over the top. I'm more interested in the gray area.

# Chapter 2A

Carrot and stick still works when applied to algorithmic work. Avoid if-then rewards. Establish genuine motivating environment.

"In other words, where “if-then” rewards are a mistake, shift to “now that” rewards—as in “Now that you’ve finished the poster and it turned out so well, I’d like to celebrate by taking you out to lunch.”

No major questions from this chapter.

# Chapter 3

Type X behavior fueled by extrinsic desires. Type I is more desirable, fueled by inherent satisfaction of work.

Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose. 

The chapter assumes every person lives this way, but I am not sure I agree.

# Chapter 4

Seek autonomy in the workplace over their task, time, technique, and team. Small changes if big ones not possible.

"We’re designed to be Type I. But outside forces—including the very idea that we need to be “managed”—have conspired to change our default setting and turn us into Type X. If we update the environments we’re in—not only at work, but also at school and at home—and if leaders recognize both the truth of the human condition and the science that supports it, we can return ourselves and our colleagues to our natural state."

Would like to see more proof of this working. Too many ways to game the system. Does everyone thrive in an autonomous system?

# Chapter 5

Achieving mastery requires specific mindset and moments of "flow."

"You start to get ashamed that what you’re doing is childish,” Csikszentmihalyi explained.

Is everyone "mastery oriented?" Or just a certain subset of the population.

# Chapter 6

Having a purpose larger than profit is better for both the person and for profit. Focus on the 'why'.

It’s in our nature to seek purpose. But that nature is now being revealed and expressed on a scale that is demographically unprecedented and, until recently, scarcely imaginable. The consequences could rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world.

This chapter more than particular seems focused on white-collar creative work. I'm not sure this applies to the much larger portion of algorithmic jobs.
