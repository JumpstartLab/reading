## Chapter 1
* Tweet Summary
  * People are motivated by purpose more than by profit. Rewarding them with profit can stunt their productivity and happiness.
* Favorite Quote
  * In other words, companies that typically rely on external rewards to manage their employees run some of their most important systems with products created by nonemployees who don’t seem to need such rewards.
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * How can people afford to work 20-30 hour per week on an open source project? What about their jobs and families?

## Chapter 2
* Tweet Summary
  * External rewards narrow focus which is not good for creativity, long term thinking, and performance when requiring heuristics.
* Favorite Quote
  * Knutson writes, “This may explain why casinos surround their guests with reward cues (e.g., inexpensive food, free liquor, surprise gifts, potential jackpot prizes)—anticipation of rewards activates the [nucleus accumbens], which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of individuals switching from risk-averse to risk-seeking behavior.”22
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * When parents use a sticker system to promote good behavior in kids, that seems to work. Why?



## Chapter 3
* Tweet Summary
  * Type I behavior is more productive because people are intrinsically motivated rather than acting based on rewards.
* Favorite Quote
  * Think of Type X behavior as coal and Type I behavior as the sun.
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * How do you motivate people to exhibit Type I behavior?

## Chapter 4
* Tweet Summary
  * Autonomy is important in the workplace, companies that promote
    type I behavior have happier and more productive employees.
* Favorite Quote
  * Have you ever seen a six-month-old or a three-year-old who’s not curious and self-directed?
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * I want to hear more about call centers where people work from home. That
    seems very interesting (even as an option for livingsocial).

## Chapter 5
* Tweet Summary
  * People are more productive and happier when in flow (mastery and enjoyment). Use that to remove the barrier between work and play.
* Favorite Quote
  * The best predictor of success, the researchers found, was the prospective cadets’ ratings on a noncognitive, nonphysical trait known as “grit”—defined as “perseverance and passion for long-term goals.”
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * Given mastery is an asymptote, are you better off with the mindset that you need to get better or that you are pretty darn good as is once you are close. Which is better for performance and which is better for happiness?

## Chapter 6
* Tweet Summary
  * Having a sense of purpose can make people happy and more productive. Giving that flexibility at work can help.
* Favorite Quote
  * Their goals, and the way companies reach them, are so incompatible to Motivation 2.0 that if TOMS had to rely on this twentieth-century operating system, the whole endeavor would seize up and crash in the entrepreneurial equivalent of a blue screen of death.
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * If science shows that purpose is so much more important than money, why do people (even those who are aware of the science) still operate with money as a goal?

## Type I Toolkit
### Awakening your motivation

### How to improve company/office/group

  * If your work environment doesn't promote Type I, try to make small changes one at a time to make it better.
* Favorite Quote
  * But what if we flipped our thinking—and designed our workplace policies for the 85 percent rather than the 15 percent?
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * How important is a Type I workplace, at what point would it be worth leaving a job that doesnt promote that.

### Paying people the Type I way
* Tweet Summary
  * Pay good people more than average so money is not an issue in their motivation process.
* Favorite Quote
  * “The salespeople thought the move was, generally, a good one, but that other salespeople wouldn’t,” Davidson says.
* Objections/disagreements/unanswered questions
  * If everyone pays above average for good talent, then it takes all the power away from companies and the price for good work keeps going up. That has the potential to make smaller companies not able to compete. How will that work in the long term?
