# Drive
Chapter-by-chapter review
JQ

## Chapter 1
* The 21st century model: intrinsic motivation, not enxtrinsic motiviation, drives all.
* "That hyperrational caluclator-brained person wasn't real. He was a convenient fiction."

## Chapter 2
* Carrots and sticks, contrary to popular belief, are usually a poor method of motivation.
* "For artists, scientists, inventors, schoolchildren and the rest of us, intrinsic motivation - the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing - is essential for high levels of creativity"

## Chapter 2A
* Sometimes - for repetitive, straight-line tasks - carrot-and sticks can be useful.
* "As long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as they would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance."

## Chapter 3
* Type I people want recognition & mastery. Type X people want $$$.
* "Think of type X behavior as coal and type I behavior as the sun. FOr most of recent history, coal has been the cheapest, easiest, most efficient resource. But coal has two downsides. First, it produces nasty things like air pollution and greenhouse gases. Second, it's finite; getting ore of it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive each year. Type X behavior is similar...but Type I behavior, which is built around intrinsic motivation, draws on resources that are easily replenished and inflict little damage. It is the motivational equivilant of clean energy: inexpensive, safe to use, and endlessly renewable."

## Chapter 4
* Autonomy = key in a 3.0 workplace.
* "Autonomy, as they see it, is different from independence. It's not the rugged, go-it-alone, rely-on-nobody individualism of the American cowboy. It means acting with choice - which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others."
* How, in an autonomous workplace, do you determine what the 'right amount' of work is? Also, why is flex time implied to be free time - but the assumption is that you are working on things the company can still find useful? Truly free time would mean that I could do things that I want to master but may or may not be of use to the company - I might want to spend my free time becoming a killer Rock Band player and that would increase morale, but it wouldn't do much for the company beyond that...

## Chapter 5
* Seek mastery. Set employees in a situation where they can strive for mastery.
"'Being a professional,' Julius Erving once said, 'is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don't feel like doing them.'"

## Chapter 6
* Purpose, it keeps you going strong, like a car with a full tank of gas
* "If we were to lok at history's greatest achievements - from the printing press to constitutional democracy to cures for deadly diseases - the spark taht kept the creators working deep into the night was purpose at least as much as profit."
