Mike Chlipala's notes.

ch_01
1. As today's jobs grow in complexity and need for creativity, it's clear that our traditional understanding of incentives and rewards needs drastic overhaul.
2. "...external rewards and punishments-both carrots and sticks-can work nicely for algorithmic tasks. But they can be devastating for heuristic ones."
3. Nothing, interesting read. 

ch_02
1. Extrinsic rewards to boost short-term performance ultimately have devastating long-term effect.
2. "People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity."
3. This chapter made me think about how capitalism influences the growth and execution of a public company. I wonder how much traction is actually being gained by companies filing as non-standard, longer-term-growth corporations.

ch_02_a
1. Extrinsic rewards can be useful in the right context: incentivize non-stimulating work and as an unexpected reward
2. "Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete."
3. Nope.

ch_03
1. Humans want a combination of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We're most productive and happy when all are satisfied.
2."Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives."
3. The author seems to have a bias towards Type I personalities. But, for instance, how can you objectively compare a Type I and Type X personality on "performance" and determine who outperformed the other. Seems a little naive....

ch_04
1. Autonomy boosts happiness, creativity, productivty, and collaboration. It seems that managers tend to just ruin everything in the meantime.
2. "Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four Ts: their task, their time, their technique, and their team."
3. Best Buy is effectively done for, and Google's version of 20-percent time today is drastically different from what it used to be. :) I here those two examples all the time anyways, who else is doing this effectively at a bigger scale?

ch_05
1. Mastery is never fully achieved. Mastery helps to achieve flow, a key compnent to our well-being.
2. "The desire to do something because you find it deeply satisfying and personally challenging inspires the highest levels of creativity, whether it's in the arts, sciences, or businesses."
3. An inspiring chapter, no doubt.

ch_06
1. Perceiving purpose to your work fuels your happiness. Profit goals alone to do little to boost happiness.
2. "It's in our nature to seek purpose. But that nature is now being revealed and expressed on a scale that is demographically unprecedented and, until recently, scarcely imaginable. The consequences could rejuvinate our business and remake our world."
3. Glad to be here.
