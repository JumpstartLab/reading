Chapter 1

Summary:
Motivation 2.0 system of reward and punishment doesn't work anymore. For heuristic tasks, we are motivated by purpose rather than profit.

Favorite quote:
"In the fist ten years of this century -- a period of truly staggering underachievement in business, technology, and social progress -- we've discovered that this sturdy, old operating system doesn't work nearly as well... It is proving incompatible with many aspects of contemporary business. And if we examine those incompatibility problems closely, we'll realize that modest updates -- a patch here or there -- will not solve the problem. What we need is a full-scale upgrade."

Objections/disagreements:
Why does Motivation 2.0 still work in the places that we're outsourcing our labor to?


Chapter 2

Summary:
Extrinsic reward crowds out intrinsic good behavior and reduces performance, creativity, and focus on long-term by turning play into work.

Favorite quote:
"Intrinsic motivation... is essential for high levels of creativity. But the 'if-then' motivators that are the staple of most business often stifle, rather than stir, creative thinking. As the economy moves toward more right-brain, conceptual work... this might be the most alarming gap between what science knows and what business does."

Objections/disagreements:
none


Chapter 2a

Summary:
Rewards work for routine tasks. If giving rewards for creative task, should be told after completion. Praise better than tangible rewards.

Objections/disagreements:

Chapter 3

Summary:
Humans want to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected. People can be type X or type I depending on what motivates them.

Favorite quote:
"Ultimately, Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose."

Objections/disagreements: To me it seems like X and I are opposite ends of a spectrum and not quite so separate as Pink makes it seem. I think most people are both and behavior varies based on the situation.


Chapter 4

Summary:
People want autonomy in their tasks, time, technique and team. Having control over what you do and when fosters productivity and happiness.

Favorite quote:
"Ever wonder why lawyers, as a group, are so miserable?"

Objections/disagreements:
none


Chapter 5

Summary:
Mastery is a mindset -- learning goals over performance. It's a pain -- it's not fun and it's unattainable. People need flow to be happy.

Favorite quote:
From Csikszentmihalyi: "There is no reason to believe any longer that only irrelevant 'play' can be enjoyed, while the serious business of life must be borne as a burdensome cross. Once we realize that the boundaries between work and play are artificial, we can take matters in hand and begin the difficult task of making life more livable."

Objections/disagreements:
Not an objection per se, but I am curious about the study that showed that people develop symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder when deprived of flow. It doesn't seem to me that depriving people of things that make them happy is the same as depriving them of flow. What's the difference between flow and doing things that make you feel good?


Chapter 6

Summary:
People want purpose -- to stand for something and contribute to the world. This is evident in their goals, words, and policies.

Favorite quote:
"It's in our nature to seek purpose. But that nature is now being revealed and expressed on a scale that is demographically unprecedented and, until recently, scarcely imaginable. The consequences could rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world."

Objections/disagreements:
none
