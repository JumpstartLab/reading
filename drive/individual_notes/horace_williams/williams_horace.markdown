#Introduction

###Tweet Summary:
You & Me baby are more than just mammals; hums have powerful intrinsic drive in addition to sex/food(drive 1) and reward/punishment(drive 2)

###Favorite quote:
> If the monkeys were rewarded—with raisins!—for solving the puzzles, they'd no doubt perform even better. Yet when Harlow tested that approach, the monkeys actually made *more* errors and solved the puzzles *less* frequently.

###Objection/Comment:
The only people Pink's outlook doesn't seem to address are the ones who are able to be both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated. Part of the premise for the book seems to be that if a person can get motivated under their own metaphysicalsteam, they will be successful. But once a person is successful, it seems that they would be in a position to come back to the bargaining table for an extra serving of "extrinsic" motivation.

#Chapter 01

###Tweet Summary:
Biological motivations are good for survival; extrinsic motivations are good for basic, repetitive tasks; 21st century needs motivation 3.0

###Favorite quote:
> As humans formed more complex societies, bumping up against strangers and needing to cooperate in order to get things done, an operating system based purely on the biological drive was inadequate. In fact, sometimes we needed ways to *restrain* this drive—to prevent me from swiping your dinner and you from stealing my spouse. And so in a feat of remarkable cultural engineering, we slowly replaced the existing version with one more compatible with how we'd now begun working and living.

###Objection/Comment:
Wikipedia is an awesome example of the power of unharnessed community effort, but there are still a lot of examples where bureaucratic/legal infrastructure inhibited community effort for the benefit of entrenched interests (consider SOPA, Hollywood vs. Pirating, etc. etc.) In some industries the Motivation 3.0 model seems to win out because it offers a competitive advantage, but is it possible there are situations where the reverse is true? How do we combat entrenched interests for the sake of opening up new efficiency improvements.

---------------------------------

#Chapter 02

###Tweet Summary:
Extrensic motivators tend to crowd out our existing intrinsic drive in creative contexts - performance decreases and we are tempted to cheat

###Favorite quote:
> In other words, rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge. They can turn play into work. And by diminishing intrinsic motivation, they can send performance, creativity, and even upstanding behavior toppling like dominoes.

###Objection/Comment:
This was a great chapter. It seems to be an awesome case for turning the rabid big-business/mega-corp favoritism on its head. Still curious whether Dan Pink (or others reading the book) think the Mot 3.0 advantages are expected to pan out across all industries, or if there are certain fields (government, Defense, infrastructure) that will successfully resist the movement. It often feels like the industries that have the least Mot3-0 attitudes are the ones that can successfully defend themselves against external change. How do we tear down that wall?

#Chapter 02a

###Tweet Summary:
In the right situation, if/then still works - esp. if given good context/rationale and accompanied with autonomy; unexpected rewards also help

###Favorite quote:
>Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project—and offering it as a contingency—will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem. But introducing the subject of rewards after the job is done is less risky

#Chapter 03

###Tweet Summary:
Type X's rely on eXternal motivs; Type I's on Internal. We need more Type I's for today's tasks. This mindset flourishes in Motivation 3.0

###Favorite quote:
> But mcGregor said there was an alternative view of emplyees—one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies. This perspective held that taking an interest in work is "as natural as play or res," that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility.

#Chapter 04

###Tweet Summary:
Autonomy & Self-Direction are our default & healthy state; unfortunately the man is always gettin us down. DOWN WITH THE MAN. VIVA LA REVOLUTION!

###Favorite quote:
> Indeed, Gunther thinks that in a ROWE environment, employees are far less likely to jump to another job for a $10,000 or even $20,000 increase in salary. The freedom they have to do great work is more valuable, and harder to match, than a pay raise...

###Objection/Comment:
How does one disagree? "No, I think people should work slavish hours under constant supervision?" Obviously this chapter seems great to me & the other "self-motivated" academites - the more freedom the better. It's definitely interesting to think that many of our tendencies toward external guidance and laziness are actually manufactured by management rather than suppressed by them. Probz truth.

---------------------------------

#Chapter 05

###Tweet Summary:
Mastery is another natural human tendency - it is achieved through hard work, appreciation of incremental improvement, and a focus on 'flow'

###Favorite quote:
On different views of intelligence:
> Those who have an "entity theory" believe that intelligence is just that—an entity. It exists within us, in a finite supply that we cannot increase. Those who subscribe to an "incremental theory" take a different view. They eblieve that while intelligence may vary slightly from perosn to person, it is ultimately somethign that, with effort, we can increase.

###Objection/Comment:
The mastery concept is awesome but I think Pink could have taken it a little further and gotten into some of the ideas of Craftsmanship/Apprenticeship that have been percolating in the Software world. Trying to inject mastery into the workplace is one thing, but I think what a lot of professions need is a return to a more humane model of gradual improvement and mastery.

---------------------------------

#Chapter 06

###Tweet Summary:
We long to have defining purpose in our lives; For a while, business sucked at this, but as Boomers look back on their sad existence, things are changing.

###Favorite quote:
> ... the two bookend generations "are redefining succes [and] are willing to accept a radically 'remixed' set of reward." Neither generation rates money as the most important form of compensation. Instead they choose a range of nonmonetary factors—from "a great team" to "the ability to give back to society through work."

###Objection/Comment:
Mothereffing Baby Boomers. Seriously. Always breaking everything. These are the same people who promised revolution and change as riled youths, but then went on to work boring white collar careers once shit got real in the 70's. It's neat to think that they'll suddenly change their mind in their twilight years (once they broke everything) but I'll believe it when I see it.
