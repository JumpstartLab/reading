## Chapter 1:
Tweet: Motivation theory needs to evolve to satisfy intrinsic needs.

Quote: "Humans are more than the sum of our biological urges."  "economists are finally realizing that we're full-fledged human beings, not single-minded economic robots."

Objections: No.  This makes sense to me.




## Chapter 2:
Tweet: Carrots aren't that tasty and sticks aren't that intimidating.

Quote: "People use rewards expecting to gain teh benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity."

Objections: I've lived through this.  So, I agree.



## Chapter 2a:
Tweet: Caveat: Carrots & Strings can work for routine tasks.  Not creative problem solving.

Quote: "Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project-and offering it as a cintingency-will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem.  But introducing the subject of rewards after the job is done is less risky"

Objections: Agree.



## Chapter 3:
Tweet: Type X people are going to be miserable in the long run.  Go Type I for true happiness.

Quote: "Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives."

Objections: I think it'd be harder to switch people than he lets on.



## Chapter 4:
Tweet: Autonomy is important to human existance.  Give a little room and watch the workforce flourish.

Quote: "The don't have to be in the office at a certain time-or any time, for that matter.  They just have to get their work done. How they do it, when they do it, and where they do it is up to them"

Objections: Some people need more structure and guidance along the way.  Total autonomy should be earned after you show that you can handle it and also want it.



## Chapter 5:
Tweet: Confucious say: Mastery is pursued, never achieved.  The joy is in the pursuit, not the attainment.

Quote: "Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery.  And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one's way in today's economy."
"Once we realize that boundaries between work and play are artificial, we can take matters in hand and begin the difficult task of making life more livable"

Objections: This is very true, but it's hard to get people to realize this and still pursue.



## Chapter 6:
Tweet: Tripods only work with three legs.  Purpose makes the third leg of the Motivation 3.0 tripod.

Quote: "Humanize what people say and you may well humanize what they do."
"We're designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren't when we're clamoring for validation from others, but when we're listening to our own voice-doing soemthing that matters, doing it well, and doing it in teh service of a cause larger than ourselves."

Objections: Tell an employee why it's important, you will either get them behind your cause, or you will have them think the project is full of shit.  Example: Brand 2.0 video.
