##Chapter 1
1. To date, humanity has had two models for motivation - one of necessity and one of extrinsic reward.  There is yet a third model, though, consisting primarily of intrinsic reward that we are only beginning to understand.
2. "In a world of perfect information and low transaction costs, the parties will bargain to a wealth-maximizing result"
3. I don't think that 'Model 2' can be completely eschewed unless we substantially compensate for basic need.  Money and profit _will_ drive people, and a fair amount of people to do incredible things.

##Chapter 2
1. Rewards as a performance mechanism can vastly enhance short-term productivity, but they also can hinder long-term development and success in that they blind their actors to the larger picture.
2. "The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later'
3. Is the non-reward scheme confined to purely heuristic  tasks?  And if so, what category of activity does executive-level decision making fall under?  If executives game the system for bonuses, can we say that their activity is ultimately more algorithmic than heuristic? 

##Chapter 2A
1. If-then reward schemes have their place in mostly algorithmic and/or mechanical work, and can actually be used to enhance the completion of menial or otherwise boring tasks.
2. "And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose."  
"Repeated now-that bonuses can quickly become expected if-then entitlements - which can ultimately crater effective performance."  
3. None, liked the little model at the end.

##Chapter 3
1. The canonical type A and B personalities also fall under the motivational 2.0 model - this chapter proposes a new type of personality model, 'Type I', which espouses conforment to the intrinsic motivational model. 
2. "By contrast, Type X behavior is something people learn through their experiences at home, at school, and at work."
3. To what degree does society actually mold us to be reward-seeking, per the quote above?  We've seen studies with children quoted above, but I wonder if the work-as-life model isn't entirely to blame itself more than anything else.  And the degree to which this "intrinsic reward" model needs to be taken to actually see fulfillment.  What would happen if you placed a human in a model where all of their basic needs were met to the point where they had to do nothing to actually fend for themselves, and they were left with unlimited free time?  I think that to some degree that person might implode without a creative outlet.

##Chapter 4
1. One of the greatest functions of the third wave or model of motivation is autonomy, as it extends to our work, time, techniques we use on the job, and the people with whom we work.
2. "[Management] is, as the strategy guru Gary Hamel has observed, a technology - and an 1850's technology at that"  
"The ultimate freedom for creative groups is the freedom to experiment with new ideas. Some skeptics insist that innovation is expensive.  In the long run, innovation is cheap.  Mediocrity is expensive - and autonomy can be the antidote"
3. Is there ever a situation or examples of a situation where too MUCH autonomy can hinder productivity?  Or would the situation wherein a task never gets completed because no one takes it up because they don't have to an example of a market failure or the failure of an idea or task?

##Chapter 5
1. Mastery over work is another tenet of the third wave or model of motivation, and it is comprised of the notion of forever trying to better excel at your craft, recognition that true mastery is unattainable, and the pursuit of "flow" or a state where all else falls to the wayside but your craft.
2. "It struck me at that point that grown-ups really have no idea how to live."  
"If people are conscious about what puts them into flow, they'll have a clearer idea of what they should devote the time and dedication to master"  
3. Are there external factors or conditions under which the parameters for optimal flow can be achieved? (e.g., lighting, temperature, space, etc. - weird, stupid/throwaway question, got nothing else)

##Chapter 6
1. Purpose is the third and final tenet of the third wave/model of motivation; it holds that the desire for purpose in work impells much of the emerging business and work in the first world and feeds workers natural drive towards self-fulfillment.
2. "When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen."
3. Just overall, I'm still curious about the extent to which motivation 3.0 can be applied pandemically to all working environments and/or the extent to which even and updated or 'improved' motivation 2.5 or 2.1 can really be incorporated into non-'creational' jobs or occupations.
