Motivation 2.0 = carrot & stick.  M2.0 is better for algorithmic work.  For heuristic, creative work, M2.0 can be very harmful.

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"Open source depends on intrinsic motivation with the same ferocity that older business models rely on extrinsic motivation"
“If you need me to motivate you, I probably don’t want to hire you.”

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
I think the author oversimplifies many of the concepts into some bucket of binary bits.  Intrinsic or extrinsic.  Algorithmic versus heuristic.  The world never seems that simple.  I understand that the simplifications were made in order to derive clearer examples.  E.g, "The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that in the United States, only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work, while 70 percent comes from heuristic work."  It seems to be that you can't be a mix of one & the other.  You're either A or B.

Humans (and economies) are complex; and while you can tease out certain behaviors & test them in isolation (e.g., using psychological experiments), when these behaviors are mixed back into the real world where motivations & situations are no longer isolated, it seems harder to predict the outcome.

M2.0 covers baseline rewards.  M3.0 goes beyond that.  M2.0 motivators used in M3.0 areas tend to lead to negative motivation & results.

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again.”

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
"Among the starkest findings, especially for men: “The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later.”  Why would women be less sensitive to this effect?

Type X (fueled more by extrinsic factors) is less productive versus Type I behavior (fueled more by intrinsic factors), says SDT research.

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives. "

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
I thought the demonization of Type X to be silly towards the end; and with arguments couched in eco-parlance, it just seemed overboard & outrageous.  "Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose." I.e., Type I is organic, Type X is not.  "Think of Type X behavior as coal and Type I behavior as the sun."  Type X is pollution.  Type I is green.  And lumping Type X, Type A, and Motivation 2.0 motivators in the same bucket, all of these are to be considered toxic.  It all seems overblown.



##CHAPTER 4 -
###Summarize the chapter in a tweet
Type I relies on autonomy.  The core of autonomy is the 4 T’s: task, time, technique, team.  Each amount of control depends on the person.

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
There is one glaring exception: pessimists do better at law.”
"Studies have shown that perceived control is an important component of one’s happiness. However, what people feel like they want control over really varies, so I don’t think there’s one aspect of autonomy that’s universally the most important. Different individuals have different desires, so the best strategy for an employer would be to figure out what’s important to each individual employee.”

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
"And although two employees struggled with the freedom and left?"  What specific circumstances motivated these employees to leave?
"For the first ninety days of the new year, the entire twenty-two-person operation would try an experiment."  Does ROWE scale?  The team was only 22 people.  Would this work for larger teams & organizations?



##CHAPTER 5 -
###Summarize the chapter in a tweet
Flow is spiritual oxygen & feeds mastery.  Mastery is a mindset, a pain, an asymptote.  Be optimistic, "pain is gain", aim for the horizon.

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement."
"Maybe reaching flow, not for a single moment but as an ethic for living—maintaining that beautiful “eye-on-the-object look” to achieve mastery as a cook, a surgeon, or a clerk—was the answer. Maybe this was the way to live."

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
As an employee trying to maximize flow & maintain autonomy, how do you re-align your work goals with the business's needs when they seem to diverge?
"The flow-centered strategy worked well enough that Ericsson began using it in offices around the world."  Is Ericsson still a profitable business?



##CHAPTER 6-
###Summarize the chapter in a tweet
Purpose provides balance to & is a catalyst in our drive to obtain autonomy & mastery.  

###What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"The value of a life can be measured by one’s ability to affect the destiny of one less advantaged. Since death is an absolute certainty for everyone, the important variable is the quality of life one leads between the times of birth and death.”

###What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
"Boomers aren’t singing alone in their chorus of purpose. Joining them, and using the same hymnbook, are their sons and daughters—known as Generation Y, the millennials, or the echo boomers."  Did the author really leave out Gen X simply because of the letter 'X'?
"In the United States alone, more people belong to a co-op than own shares in the stock market."  With 401ks & mutual funds, I have doubts that this assertion is true.
"Some of the U of R students had what Deci, Ryan, and Niemiec label “extrinsic aspirations”—for instance, to become wealthy or to achieve fame—what we might call “profit goals.” Others had “intrinsic aspirations”—to help others improve their lives, to learn, and to grow—or what we might think of as “purpose goals.” After these students had been out in the real world for between one and two years, the researchers tracked them down to see how they were faring. The people who’d had purpose goals and felt they were attaining them reported higher levels of satisfaction and subjective well-being than when they were in college, and quite low levels of anxiety and depression."  What percentage Type I students reported that they were attaining their goals?  Type X students?  Even though the Type I "attainers" felt better, were fewer reporting that were attaining their goals (versus Type X students)?
