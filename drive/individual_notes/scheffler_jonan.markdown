## Assignment
1. Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters
2. What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
3. What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?

### Introduction
1. Experiments by Harry Harlow and Edward Deci using puzzles indicate that some tasks offer an intrinsic reward by their very nature.
2. One who is interested in developing and enhancing the intrinsic motivation in children, employees, students, etc., should not concentrate on external-control systems such as monetary rewards. - Edward Deci
3. If a lack of external-control systems actually leads more productive employees why doesn't a free market trend in that direction?

### Chapter 1
1. The nature of work is changing on a global scale and Motivation 2.0 (carrots and sticks) is less applicable to today's companies.
2. Apache's share of the global web server market: 52 percent. (presently 64.91% [Web Server Market Share](http://bit.ly/apache_stats "Web Server Market Share"))
3. What actionable steps does Pink reccomend for corporations?

### Chapter 2
1. Monetary rewards are addictive; subjects who are offered rewards experience diminished intrinsic motivation.
2. If someone's baseline rewards aren't adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance.
3. Why does nuclear accumbens stimulation necessarily imply addiction? This area of the brain is stimulated by all sorts of rewards including food, sex and even placebo effects. If stimulating the nuclear accumbens diminishes intrinsic motivation shouldn't we see similar effects for other stimulants like food and sex?

### Chapter 3
1. Self-determination Theory suggests that humans need competence, autonomy and relatedness. 
2. If you believe in the mediocrity of the masses, then mediocrity becomes the ceiling of what you can achieve.
3. Pink says that extrinsically motivated (Type X) people are often just as successful as intrinsically motivated (Type I) people, although the rest of his book seems to state very clearly that intrinsic motivation is more powerful for most relevant tasks today. Is he simply trying to placate his Type X readers?

### Chapter 4
1. Type I behavior emerges when people have control over the four 'T's of autonomy: task, time, technique and team.
2. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover.
3. In a sharp transition to autonomy Pink says that employees need a scaffold or they will struggle. What does that look like? How is it implemented?

### Chapter 5
1. The pursuit of mastery is frequently accompanied by a state of flow; the result of goldilocks tasks: those that are neither too challenging nor too basic.
2. From the Greek auto (self) and telos (goal or purpose). In an autotelic experience the goal is self-fulfilling; the activity is its own reward.
3. Can goldilocks tasks be assigned systematically within an organization?

### Chapter 6
1. Happiness follows purpose. The need to have an effect larger than yourself, to be part of something that matters.
2. When am I going to do something that matters? When am I going to live my best life? When am I going to make a difference in the world?
3. Purpose seems the most likely of the three to manifest in Motivation 2.0. I think it has been well established that seeking wealth can change the world as a byproduct; does that fail to fulfill the need for purpose?
