Chapter 1
=========

People posses intrinsic motivation, and rewards nullify intrinsic motivation.

"external rewards and punishments—both carrots and sticks—can work nicely for algorithmic tasks. But they can be devastating for heuristic ones."

Chapter 2
=========

Rewards turn play into work. Punishment can often result in more of what you don't want.

"Only contingent rewards—if you do this, then you’ll get that—had the negative effect. Why? “If-then” rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy."

Chapter 3
=========

People who are intrinsically motivated perform better than extrinsically motivated people.

"Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives."

Chapter 4
=========

Lack of autonomy leads to less focus and interest.

"Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T’s: their task, their time, their technique, and their team."

Chapter 5
=========

People perform the best when they are challenged, but not so much as to instill anxiety.

"One source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what people can do. When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is boredom."

Chapter 6
=========

Don't over compensate, and focus on the people and not arbitrary, shitty rules.

“The goals of management are usually described in words like ‘efficiency,’ ‘advantage,’ ‘value,’ ‘superiority,’ ‘focus,’ and ‘differentiation.’ Important as these objectives are, they lack the power to rouse human hearts.”
