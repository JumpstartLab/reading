# Chapter 1:

## Tweet: The standard motivation structure (for 20th centry work) is less appropriate for highly creative 21st century workplaces.

## Quote: Just as oxen and then forklifts replaced simple physical labor, computers are replacing simple intellectual labor.

## Question: This seems to go back to the truism that if we all grew up to be what we wanted to be, this would be a world of firemen, doctors and astronauts. Surely there's not much intrinsic motivation for the janitors, garbage collectors, and sewer workers of America, even though their jobs are not necessarily purely mechanical. How do we motivate them?


# Chapter 2:

## Tweet: We only have room to be motivated in one way about something at a time, and extrinsic is much worse than intrinsic motivation.

## Quote: "Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do."

## Question: I wonder if everybody reacts the same way - are there some people out there who are truly happy with a simplified piecemeal or pure-commission structure? And if so, is their work inherently less inspired than that of people who aren't?


# Chapter 3:

## Tweet: Some people are more aligned with an intrinsic motivation system; others are more easily extrinsically motivated.

## Quote: If you believed in the "mediocrity of the masses", them mediocrity became the ceiling on what you could achieve.

## Question: Can type I behavior be learned? Or once I've falled in to type X ways, is it hard to break out of them?


# Chapter 4: 

## Tweet: Freedom to do your work in the way you see fit is a crucial component of intrinsic motivation.

## Quote: We're born to be players, not pawns.

## Question: Call center work seems fundamentally counter to autonomy. Zappos seems to do a reasonably good job of it, but they have to be sacrificing some fundamentals of call center operation (AHT, Adherence, % Occupancy, etc). The only way I can think of to counter that tradeoff is by hiring more people to make up the difference - I wonder how expensive that difference is.


# Chapter 5: 

## Tweet: The endless pursuit of mastery over a skill is its own reward.

## Quote: Being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don't feel like doing them.

## Question: What do we call it when we're happy with what our skill level is, and continue to execute a task because we're good at it and enjoy that feeling of being good at something?


# Chapter 6:

## Tweet: For a type I individual, why we do something is at least as important as how.

## Quote: When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen.

## Question: Again, it seems as though there are some tasks in this world that just don't lend themselves to a sense of purpose. McDonalds is always going to need fry cooks; how do we send those employees home feeling like they've made the world a better place?
