# Drive Notes - Travis Valentine

## Part One - A New Operating System

#### Chapter 1 - The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Motivation 2.0 worked great for a while but isn't sufficient for the way our society is currently structured.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  McGregor challenged the presumption that humans are fundamentally inert—that absent external rewards and punishments, we wouldn’t do much. People have other, higher drives, he said. And these drives could benefit businesses if managers and business leaders respected them.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  Do you think we'll ever revert to a Motivation 2.0 culture again or do you think we'll transition away from it for good?

#### Chapter 2 - Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work...

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Pay and reward structures can do more damage than good, taking away all the things you want in an employee.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  As the economy moves toward more right-brain, conceptual work—as more of us deal with our own versions of the candle problem—this might be the most alarming gap between what science knows and what business does.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  If people learn that labor compensation is all merit/intrinsic focused then would that impact the structure of other sectors of society?

#### Chapter 2A - ...and the Special Circumstances When They Do

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Rewards for completing menial tasks can be beneficial if the conditions are framed the right way.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  If extrinsic rewards rely less on cash, how do companies offer more appealing cultures if businesses reward good work in similar ways? Wouldn't they just be pushed to offer monetary rewards?

#### Chapter 3 - Type I and Type X

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Motivation 3.0 shifts the focus from extrinsic to instrinsic and takes rewards off the table by providing adequate compensation.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  “If there’s anything [fundamental] about our nature, it’s the capacity for interest. Some things facilitate it. Some things undermine it,” Ryan explained during one of our conversations. Put another way, we’ve all got that third drive.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  Is Type I behavior the true solution to work-life balance that has plagued society for so long? Or at least a step in the right direction?

## Part Two - The Three Elements

#### Chapter 4 - Autonomy

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  By hiring good people and getting out of their way, letting them own their work, an organization is more productive.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T’s: their task, their time, their technique, and their team.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_
  
  How do you adjust to employees changing focus or passion in their job?

#### Chapter 5 - Mastery

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Understanding where one achieves flow allows them to see where they can achieve mastery by setting learning goals.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is boredom. (Indeed, Csikszentmihalyi titled his first book on autotelic experiences Beyond Boredom and Anxiety.) But when the match is just right, the results can be glorious. This is the essence of flow.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  How can employers encourage mastery in environments where there are natural ebbs and flows in burnout, etc.?

#### Chapter 6 - Purpose

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Aligning an organization's future with a purpose changes the organization. If that happens more broadly, our conception of business changes.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  The most deeply motivated people—not to mention those who are most productive and satisfied—hitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_
  
  How much is this led by generational factors? Seems like the youth are really the drivers in this sort of thing.

## Part Three - The Type I Toolkit

#### Type I for Individuals

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  There are numerous techniques for individuals to be more Type I in a transitional Type X world.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  "Deliberate practice is about changing your performance, setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time.”

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  If an individual tries to change and an organization doesn't what's the best thing to do?

#### Type I for Organizations

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  Organizations on any budget can do a lot to foster a Type I workplace.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  Second, performance reviews are rarely authentic conversations. More often, they are the West’s form of kabuki theater—highly stylized rituals in which people recite their rehearsed lines and hope the experience ends quickly.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  If creating structure sometimes leads to the behavior that structure tries to curtail, why is there still so much emphasis on structure even in organizations with otherwise ROWE tendancies.

#### The Zen of Compensation - Paying People the Type I Way

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  You can structure an organization's compensation so it fosters the same motivation seen in Motivation 2.0.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  In addition, the gain for reaching the metrics shouldn’t be too large. When the payoff for reaching targets is modest, rather than massive, it’s less likely to narrow people’s focus or encourage them to take the low road.

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  Some people will always be driven by money, right? So what do they do? Do we just not concern ourselves with them?

#### Type I for Parents and Educators - Ten Ideas for Helping Our Kids

* _Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters_

  By bringing techniques into the classroom and home, kids can be brought up to adjust to a Motivation 3.0 society.

* _What was your favorite quote of the chapter?_

  (Parents: If your child’s teacher won’t go for these DIY report cards, try it yourself at home. It’s another way to prevent school from changing your child’s default setting and turning him from Type I to Type X.)

* _What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?_

  If schools don't take well to Type I behaviors, doesn't that show they don't care about individual development?
