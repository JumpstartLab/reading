#Chapter 1
* What drives human beings has changed with the type of work we do (heuristic vs. algorithmic) and therefore we need to change the way we approach motivation.  External rewards and punishment simply will not work as effectively as they used to.

#Chapter 2
* It is entirely possible for rewards to dampen performance when it comes tasks that require creativity.  These are the seven reasons why:
** They can extinguish intrinsic motivation
** They can diminish performance
** They can crush creativity
** They can crowd out good behavior
** They can encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior
** They can become addictive
** They can foster short-term thinking


#Chapter 3
* Pink believes that we can be split into two groups: Type I and Type X.  Type Is are driven by intrinsic reward where as Type Xs focus on extrinsic reward.  Type I behavior is made, not born and typically those that are Type I have more success in the long-run as their motivation is “renewable.”  We should therefore strive to inch closer towards becoming Type I individuals.

#Chapter 4
* Autonomy is often undervalued by management.  Motivation 3.0 believes that workers want to be accountable and that by granting them autonomy over what they do, when they do it, who they do it with, and how they do it ultimately results in higher performance and better results.

# Chapter 5
* Flow is a state where our challenges meet our abilities, and it is an important component in the journey to mastery.  Those in pursuit of mastery will need the tenacity and the recognition that it is impossible to fully master anything. Mastery attracts because mastery eludes.

#Chapter 6
* Motivation 3.0 stresses the importance of purpose maximization. People who believe they are working towards a greater purpose will have the satisfaction and feeling that they belong to something greater and more permanent than themselves.  While those with strong extrinsic goals might be serving their own self-interest, they are likely to remain unhappy, even after achieving their goals.
