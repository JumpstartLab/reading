* Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters
The work we do is changing from routine tasks toward creative endeavors. Traditional external motivators do not work as well for creative tasks as intrinsic motivators. 
* What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
"'Intrinsic motivation is of great importance for all economic activities. It is inconceivable that people are motivated solely or even mainly by external incentives.'" - Bruno Frey
* What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
Is there persistence of internal motivation over time? For example, do open source authors continue to commit for ages without external reward? What are the limitations of intrinsic motivation?

If you give people rewards for 'play', things that they already enjoy, it will become work and they will no longer be as interested in doing it. 
* What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That's helpful when there's a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster.
** By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that a task is undesirable. 
* What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with? Why are noble acts and creative acts linked in how we respond poorly to rewards for them?

Type X behavior is behavior driven by external factors. Type I behavior is fueled by intrinsic desires. Type I's do best in the long run. 
* What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
For Type I's, the main motivator is freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus. 
* What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
If all people are influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, how can we easily put people in two categories? Aren't we all type X sometimes, type I others?

#Chapter 4

For Motivation 3.0, autonomy and less traditional management is needed - people don't need prodding for creative, fulfilling work. 
* What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
Autonomy, as they see it, is different from independence. It's not the rugged, go-it-alone, rely-on-nobody individualism of the American cowboy. It means acting with choice - which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent on others.
* What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
How do managers balance prodding and autonomy support for jobs that aren't always fulfilling?

# Chapter 5

Mastery, for Type I's mindset, is something that can be achieved through incremental work. However, the road to mastery is difficult - for a long period of time. 
* What was your favorite quote of the chapter?
One source of frustration in the workplaces the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what they can do. When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is boredom. 
* What objections or disagreements or questions unanswered are you left with?
Why can't an individual by fully immersed in flow working toward mastery? Why does it have to be hard?
