# Chapter One
Summary: R understanding of motivation is outdated, a legacy of repetitive tasks, but it is actually harmful to the non-formulaic work we do now

Quote: "Just as oxen and forklifts replaced simple physical labor, computers are replacing simple intellectual labor."

Objection: I don't like the distinction between business as either 'for profit' or 'for good'.  I think that shows a misunderstanding of the market and what profits signify --- value creation.  Creating products that people are willing paying for is doing good, a lot of good.


# Chapter Two
Summary: Extrinsic rewards dampen creativity by making us narrowly focused. It turns play to work and fosters short term results or long.

Quote: Greatness and nearsightedness are incompatible.

Question: How does incentivizing blood donation compare to what is already in practice with sperm and egg donations, which are paid for.

## Chapter Two Appendix
Summary: Extrinsic rewards have their place when a task is inherently non-stimulating. Give reasoning 4 task, higher purpose, n autonomy.

Quote: "Praise and psitive feedback are much less corrosive than cash trophies."

Question: Where does gamification fit into this situation?  It seems by giving people the opportunity to compete against others seems to motivate, if recognition is given in form of leaderboards, badges, etc..

## Chapter Three
Summary: Humans have an innate drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. When that is achieved, we are happier.

Quote: "If there is anything fundamental about our nature, it's the capacity for interest."

Objection: I don't believe an adequate amount of information was given on how someone becomes a Type X person.  It seems to me that everyone is naturally intrinsically motivated they just have been misguided and need time to rediscover it.

## Chapter Four
Summary: People need autonomy. Companies are starting to shift to ROWE and giving their employees paid time to work on personal side projects

Quote: "In short, management isn't the solution, it's the problem."

Question: In many of his examples, the companies cited are software centered.  Is it that software companies are more innovative or that the type of work they do is conducive to being geographically free / results orientated?  Also, also does a ROWE policy affect a company's culture?

## Chapter Five
Summary: Mastery is a necessary component to achieving flow. It is a mindset, can be painful at times, and is never fully attained.

Quotes: 'Mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes.'

Question: For those who subscribe to entity intelligence theory, what would be their motivation for learning?  They may not achieve as much as their counterparts, but they still progress through school and challenge themselves.

## Chapter Six
Summary: People who believe their work is making a difference is the world are far more happy and productive than those who do not.

Quote: 'Purpose provides activation energy for living.'

Question: He talks extensively about the baby boomer generation and how they are shifting their focus to doing activities that make the world better, but my own experience tells me that the majority of purpose driven businesses are founded by generation y'ers.



## Quote that sums up the whole book:
'The science shows that the secret to high performance isn't our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive - our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and make a contribution.'
