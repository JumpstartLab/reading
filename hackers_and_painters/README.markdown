#### Collate & Distill

The goal is *not* to create an exhaustive list of everything written by every reader. The goal is to create a comprehensive set of the best ideas, sharpest insights, and clearest explanations. The final document should probably be 3x as long as any individual response set, but it should not be enormous. 

Use your editorial judgement and slice text with a scalpel. Cut unnecessary words, shape the "I" speaker as you see fit, condense it down to just the goods.

If it feels necessary, cite responses using the `@githubusername` style, like @jcasimir for Jeff.

### Phase 3 - Reflect

As they're submitted and time allows, read and discuss the summaries.

If you find some quotes and insights that you really respect, consider decorating some of our glass surfaces with them.
