# Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular

## Summary

* Because school lacks any significant purpose, the whole system devolves into a popularity contest as a way to derive purpose from the system.
* Students can't be smart and also popular. They must choose one or the other. There is a black and white divide between nerds and socialized students.
* Smart kids feel ostracized at school because:
* They are a safe target for the other kids to prove their popularity
* Nerds are focused on grades and 'smart' interests so they don't put time into being popular or personable.

## What Stood Out

* Suburbia causes many problems with today's teenagers. Related to this is the concept that suburbs are for breeding and creating families.
* Teenagers are driven crazy by the idleness of their lives, and they need something to work on to be sane and happy. Smart kids have hacking, popular kids have social standing.
* Teenagers would benefit from more real world training when they are young.

## Questions Unanswered

* What is the solution? How can we fix schools, where being smart is looked down upon?
* There is a generational gap in the early 2000's (90's babies). How does this affect the high school experience of 'smart people' or 'nerds' in 2012?

## Objections
* Schools do provide social experience which is inherently valuable. Even if it is painful to learn.
* High schools have problems, but the severity seems exaggerated by the author's personal experiences.
* The experience in school is not a black and white, popular or smart dichotomy.

## Takeaways
* The educational system is broken.
* The life of a 'smart person' is at it's lowest point in middle/high school.
* Smart kids aren't popular because they spend their time focusing on other things.
* Have a purpose. It tends to make things better.
