# Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

## Summary
  
* Hackers are more like painters than mathematicians. Hackers are makers.
* Startups are a great place to learn to write good software. Big firms need to play it safe, whilest startups flourish around the edges.
* Universities want hackers to be scientists, corporations want them to be engineers. They are neither.

## What Stood Out

* Relentless attention to detail can result in success in any field.
* We're approaching a golden age of hacking. The great painters were well-respected in their time - but not nearly so well-respected as they are now. The great ones tend to emerge at the very early stages of their craft - great Renaissance painters, novel writers, and of course Shakespeare.
* Teamwork applies in painting as well as in hacking/programming.
* Great hackers have empathy.

## Questions Unanswered
* Is a comparison between hacking and other maker arts really a valid comparison?
* Are all hackers makers or is there a place for hackers who are theorists/academics?

## Objections
* The author focuses on the process of makers, but glosses over the interactions between craftsman - which some would say is where the magic of creation truly occurs?
* Some hackers like figuring things out on paper beforehand as an effective way to sketch.
* He seems more focused on the creation of software itself than actually creating software that people enjoy to use.

## Takeaways
* "Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry."
* The act of writing code is a dynamic and creative experience, and most people do not treat hackers are creators but rather as mathematic problem solvers.
* Hacking is an art form.
