# Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude

## Summary
  
* Hack has several connotations from awesome - crappy.  Hacker itself has several connotations; they can be really good or really bad, evil.
* It's American to be looking under rocks, that's the nature of a true hacker.  Look at our founding fathers creating what works out of chaos.
* Hackers are living the LivingSocial value of Champion Good Ideas.  This would mean that they're solving problems that need solving, and not necessarily under direction of other people, just because they're interested in solving them for themselves.
* Government intervention and spying stops innovation, which is what America is built upon.

## What Stood Out

* He views hackers as the first line of defense against infringements on civil liberties.  Civil liberties make countries rich and hackers are the ideal focus group for civil liberties.
>"It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh."
* The best hacking has an element of wrongness.  When you start something, you don't know if it will be really great or really wrong.
> "...the reason that Florence is famous is because in 1450 it was New York.  In 1450 it was filled with the turbulent and ambitious people you now find in America.  (so I went back to America)" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* What is the difference between a "bad" idea and a "good" idea.  Who's the judge? 
* I wonder if America is on a downward trend to become like Florence.  Will America still have it's innovation glory in 100 years? Are other people thinking about this?
* Why isn't China's economy affected by their lack of civil liberties?

## Objections

* It's not about being contrary, it's more about being inspired to do something or make something - and not letting anything interfere with your inspiration.
* He seems to blur the difference between companies and artists protecting their intellectual property when he discusses Hollywood's support of such laws.
* Don't think that Americans are the only people who think dangerous thoughts, just the most likely to be caught expressing them on an international pulpit.
* Think that his insistence on the sacredness of the word "hacker" is a little bit disturbing, and far-reaching, as well as his affinity for using the term "hacker" to seem to encompass all hackers'/developer's/programmers' mindset, ethos, and overall life opinion as unified
* It's quite possible to be intellectually curious and maintain a healthy respect for society's rules and laws. I don't advocate blindly following leadership, but I don't think that means having to disregard law as a whole.

## Takeaways

* Hackers break away from the norm, not following convention.
* Be curious about everything, not just computers.
* America is a great place for tech growth because of our subversive nature.
* Following convention is a sure-fire way to avoid success.

certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive."
