# Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead

## Summary
  
* Desktop Software vs. Web Apps: web is the future because it lets us move faster and contains all of the infrastructure (clients) for us. Also of note: Why large companies are afraid of it? - @austenito
* Computing is moving to the cloud. - @1337807
* Designing web based software is like designing a city rather than a building. - @1337807 
* Web based software has no versions. - @1337807 
* Adding people to a project tends to slow it down. - @1337807
* Prediction of devices that would use web apps: Predicted iPhone. - @1337807 
* Web software is awesome because it allows you the flexibility to be cross-platform, iterate quickly, build inexpensively, and further separate users from needing to know more about how a computer works. - @athal7

## What Stood Out

* Companies are more scared of start ups (than the other way around). Smaller companies are more adaptive and can move more quickly. -@dgkaufman
* Web applications allow for releases all the time. - @tomkiefhaber
* Paul Graham says,"Software companies are accused of letting users debug their software and that's just what I am advocating" - @jkoszewski
* 

## Questions Unanswered

* What does it really mean to be in a startup & what is the "magical leap" from jumping into start up life and being successful? - @austenito 
* Does it work to have a large company broken into small enough units that they can operate as discret silos? -@marktabler
* The least technical users are the ones that need web-based software but will be the slowest to adopt. How do we address this? - @eliseworthy 

## Objections

* Argument of Web vs. Desktop development: Web development is faster because it has fewer features and is less complicated. - @austenito
* Hackers need to be SysAdmins, but with platforms like Heroku the need to understand hardware is minimized. - @1337807 
* This chapter is focused entirely on Graham's experience and success at ViaWeb and doesn't pull in other examples. - @jkoszewski
* There is more to know about running a business than "make more than you spend", for example the penny arcade guys will attest that having some business acumen will help. -@marktabler

## Takeaways

* Build something users love and make more than you spend. - @1337807 
* Get out a minimum viable product as quickly as possible & allow feedback from users. - @1337807 
* start small and scrappy and be prepared to sink your life into it. - @jkoszewski && threat of big companies are electric fences that have been turned off. -@athal7
