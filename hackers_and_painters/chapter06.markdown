# Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

## Summary

* In startup, you work extremely hard but for several years as opposed to not working very hard for the rest of your life.
* Wealth != Money. Wealth is stuff we want like food, clothes, etc. Money is a way of moving wealth.
* There is no fixed amount of wealth, you can create wealth by making things that people want

## What Stood Out

* You can be much more productive when working in a startup environment
* The first few people at any startup are extremely important since they shape the culture of the company, get things off the ground, and hire others like them
* Startups should do things that people want in order to create wealth. Tackle hard problems to create a barrier to entry, which VCs will like.

## Questions Unanswered

* `@athal7`: if startups are a way to get rich quicker, but they fail more often, over the course of an average person's lifetime do they end up working more time by going the startup route or by going the big company route. Yes one is safer and one is riskier, but in aggregate who wins?
* `@travisvalentine`: Does it go beyond just making something people want? Does it mean more if a few people just love your product as opposed to more that want it? Which is better? Is there a difference?

## Objections

* It is not always best for a startup to sell to a larger company. By his logic if you want to continue to innovate quickly you should not get acquired. Some of the best tech companies were not acquired by large companies.
* If you fix an old car and sell it for more you don't expand the pie. There is a fixed amount of money and somewhere down the end of the trail of that money someone has less money for you having gained money. You may have created extra wealth because you are enabling yourself to enjoy something more by getting money for something you made, but since there is a finite amount of currency you are not creating money.
* Today, for certain startups there can be extremely low costs that makes VC funding unnecessary.

## Takeaways

* Make things that people want and you will be successful
* Work hard in a startup for a short period of time rather than not hard for a long period of time
