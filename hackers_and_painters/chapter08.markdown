# Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

## Summary
  
*Chapter 8 is about spam -- what it is, why people send it, and how we can stop it.

## What Stood Out

*False positives become more dangerous as spam filters become more restrictive or as one receives more spam.

*It is surprising to me that spam companies actually continue to make money... it is still surprising that people click on their links.

*It is also surprising to hear that PG is interested in limiting spammers with laws and regulations. He spends a lot of time in other chapters giving the impression that he's not really for things like that. Make your own wealth, don't work for the man, etc.

*This essay was written in 2002, before most modern, web-based email services existed. It's interesting because this model of spam detection has been adopted widely, particularly with Gmail (... the distinction between a 'Delete' and a 'Mark as Spam' button was interesting to see just as spam was becoming such a wide-reaching issue)

## Questions Unanswered

*What other techniques outside of Bayesian filtering work well and are still implemented?

*Why is Graham is so opposed to "computer science" research when his spam filtering technique is exactly the sort of idea many computer scientists work on?

## Objections

*Spam will stop if people stop responding to it, but some people are enticed by the content of spam. If these people still respond to spam (15 in 1m), how will spam stop?

*This chapter doesn’t belong here.

*How does PG know that spammers will just choose not to spam if our filters continue to get better? How do you know it won’t have the opposite effect? For instance, instead of spamming 1,000,000 people they spam 30,000,000 in hopes of tricking one person?

## Takeaways

*Machine learning is an incredibly powerful technique.

*Eliminate the efficacy of spam and you eliminate spam altogether

*Personalization tasks seems to be the key. if you want something done right for an individual, you have to make it adaptable to that person, not a one-size fits all model because everyone has different preferences, needs, and interactions.
