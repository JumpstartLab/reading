# Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers

## Summary
  
* Taste is not subjective; good taste transcends disciplines (art, technology, automobiles, etc). 

* Good design is simple, timeless, and solves the right problem.


## What Stood Out

* "Taste" is not in the eye of the beholder but universal principles exist which support beauty (good design).

* Simplicity is inherent to good design. This doesn't mean good design is basic. Nor does this mean one should design to the lowest common denominator. It means that in design, one must work to deliver real substance that connects on simple terms without flowery ornamentations and superfluous detail. 

## Questions Unanswered

* Graham states that form should follow function - but doesn't this contradict what he is saying about good design being the driving factor in why we love things?  It would seem more apt to say good function is good design and vice versa. 

* Graham mentions good design arising from "hotspots", such as Firenze during the Renaissance. If this is true, what is a modern day hotspot? Would the Internet, with its various communities of people, qualify?

* He ironically does not discuss good design in software - what are some modern trends in good software design?

## Objections

*  Graham talks about ignoring fashionâ€”that all great design is in a class above fashion.  But, why does fashion become popular?  To gain mass appeal, doesn't it have to be designed well?  And, the label fashion is ad hoc because you can only know if a 'fashion' is a fad when it is no longer in vogue. 

## Takeaways

* Beauty has innate qualities; these qualities are present in all things which stand the test of time. Communities can foster innate talent. 

* Designing something to be simple and fun to use is hard. 

* I was stunned at how much this article described the design process of modern-day Apple. Good design can reward someone both at a personal and financial level.
