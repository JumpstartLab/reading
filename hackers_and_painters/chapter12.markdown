# Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages

## Summary
  
* There is a power spectrum of programming languages, with the more powerful looking down at the less powerful.  This causes a paradox due to not knowing which languages are more powerful than their own.  Therefore, try to stay towards the top, or at least ahead of the average
* If you want to be better than the average, that means being proportionally different from the average.

## What Stood Out

* That he attributed so much of the success of his web application to the programming language used to create it. I feel that argument is backwards - a successful product can help to popularize a language, but a language would not help to popularize a product.
* I like the point about using the rate at which the programming community adopts new languages against your competitors. I think the hacker community has realized this in recent years, and it seems that many developer jobs today empower developers to use whatever language they need to get the job done. Web companies today move at an incredible pace.
* How powerful lisp seems to be. I am intrigued to learn it because of how much he seems to be a proponent for it. if nothing else it might even help me with other languages.


## Questions Unanswered

* Based on Graham's paradox, is it true that a language that is more powerful than Lisp exists and he is unable to see it?
* The author says a startup should give its competitors as little information as possible, but this seems contradictory to the open source mentality. Many leading startups (37 Signals included) gives quite a bit of information publically in their blog, etc. - what's best?
* Is it really the language that sets a company apart or the companies use and implementation of that language? See Facebook with PHP, etc.
* How can you really claim to prove one language to be "most powerful"? Maybe this is sarcasm? The problem is the same as what PG identifies with the analogy of the language continuum - it's always hard to perceive those things that are higher up than you are, so if there is something higher than Lisp, how will he be able to know he isn't just missing it because Lisp is his favorite.
* How do you know at the start of a startup what language to use. if you use a less popular language for a startup that has the potential to get huge, you may have trouble recruiting. but if you use a more popular language you may not iterate as fast.
* Does Yahoo Stores still run on LISP? Or have they since converted?

## Objections

* I think that his opinion is outdated or for developers that are new to software. Hackers these days are thrown into a world were they have to use many different languages to get the job done. If another language has something more powerful, they can use a language that compiles down to bytecode or compiles it to another interpreted language. The line between languages are blurring. Even completely separate languages can pass around data and method calls using things like protocol buffers.
* PG's assumption that since Lisp supposedly makes you a better programmer, it should also result in better programs isn't really accurate to what the other sources are saying. When Eric Raymond says Lisp will teach you things but you won't actually use it, this is because the things that make a language educational and the things that make it useful aren't necessarily the same. PG's argument seems to conflate these 2 things.
* There are some obvious advantages to going with the herd that PG omits: the most expressive language in the world isn't worth using if you don't have the requisite libraries available and a dependable source for support - and there's a pretty strong correlation between such attributes and commercial adoption. One could argue that you could always implement/fix what you need... but what if what you need is a high performance implementation of multivariate linear regression? Most people would be SOL, unless they just so happened to take an AI class.
* Is it smart or even practical to continue switching to “the most powerful” language every time you start a project?

## Takeaways

* Languages are half technology and half religion
* Startups rely more on technological edge than traditional companies, and thus need to be more keenly aware of choosing the best tool for the job
* Programmers are very habitual and hidebound when it comes to language selection; it is important to be on the lookout for new developments and try not to let yourself get stuck in a rut
* Read job descriptions of other startups if you want to learn what they are working with.
* Use the most powerful language available to you. Language choice matter only in that it gives you the right tools for the task.
