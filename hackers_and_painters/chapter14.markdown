# Chapter 14
## Summary
Graham describes what he believes is the dream programming language: succinctness, hackability, can write programs quickly, easy to write libraries, and efficiency.
## Idea that surprised me
I'd be interesting to read more about the debate between having a fast profiler and rather making a statically typed language and thus making a faster compiler. Many companies (like Apple) are focusing on creating new compilers to replace aging giants like GCC, and I'm quite curious to learn more about this debate.
## Unanswered questions
What is his dream language? Lisp?
## Objections/disagreements
Computer languages are (oddly) intensely personal things, and ones dream language can differ from person to person.
## Key takeaways
I want to work on creating libraries and additions to a language that, for example, take good features from one language and bring them to another.

# Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular

## Summary
  
* Summarizes why junior high & high school suck. Kids in High School are tortured/it is a 'bad' society for smart people.

## What Stood Out

* The concept that suburbs are for breeding surprised me a bit. Not that it is entirely out of left field - it makes sense - but I haven't heard it put quite that baldly before.
* Maybe it is because I was in a small private school in the middle of a city, but I didn't feel nearly as much pain growing up as the author did. It wasn't easy, certainly - but nor was it brutal. Though I freely admit that there are parts I don't really remember and it's quite possible that I block some of it out.
* I do agree with his concept about how 'normal' kids aren't necessarily any smarter or less intelligent than their 'smart' classmates - but instead the effort that 'smart' kids put into their education is simply put elsewhere. It is very interesting to be someone who was a 'smart' kid - at least to an extent - who has now learned how to put a little bit of time into appearance, etc - so much that people sometimes doubt my 'nerd cred' until I start talking HTML/CSS/Battlestar.

## Questions Unanswered

* I'd have to check the publish date, but I don't think the author has a sense of the genrational shift that happened right about when I was in Middle/High school. While the traditional 'popular' crowds are still around - it is no longer weird for people to play games all day. It's no longer considered quite so odd when people spend all their free time on computers, instead of watching TV or movies or hanging out with friends. There's something important that happens when children have computers on their desks and in their lives at a very young age. The things that the previous generation viewed as strange or nerdy or 'smart' are things the current generation considers everyday occurances. It's a fundamental shift, and changes the picture substatially in the next five years or so.

## Objections

* The author clearly has a lot of angst about being a high school/middle school student. And I imagine his HS/JHS experience was horrific. But I believe he's generalizing from his experience and from what is show in TV and movies.
* The author doesn't seem to think that there is popularity or social forces at work in the 'smart adult' community. That's so very wrong. It's there.
* There are skills that have to do with dealing with people in a society - even a flawed one - that you can only learn by interacting with that society. Yes, it may feel false and wrong, for all the reasons that he mentions - but even smart people have things they need to learn from such situations. School won't be the last time they encounter those scenarios, but school is a relatively safe place to figure out how to handle them.

## Takeaways

* The education system is broken.
* The life of a 'smart person' is likely as low as it will ever be in middle/high school.
* Smart kids aren't popular because they spend their time focusing on other things.
* (stolen from the sample, but it resonates) Have a purpose. It tends to make things better.

# Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

## Summary

* Hacking is like painting. When practiced well, they are both about creating something beautiful.
* Both hacking and painting/design require time and thought
* Hacking is not about science. It is about making. Hackers should not look to or aspire to be scientists (especially mathemeticians), they should take their cue from the makers - the painters, the authors, the carvers and the actors.

## What Stood Out

* I love the comparison of hacking to art. Perhaps because I spend much of my time thinking of myself as an artist and a creative. I think I would substitute 'maker' for 'creative'.
* Near the end he makes an interesting point - that the great painters were well-respected in their time - but not nearly so well-respected as they are now. And the great ones tended to emerge at the very early stages of their craft - the great Renaissance painters, or novel writers, and of course Shakespeare.
* Teamwork - in a painting (for example) the great master might take the main body of the image and their apprentices work on the background. It's interesting how he applies this to hacking/programming.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

* I think he's missing two crucial elements to the process of creatives, at least in the space I am most familiar with (theatre). The effect of collaboration and the necessity of trust. He touched on collaboration briefly - but implied that in great art, every contributor is given their little defined area to work on and together they create a masterwork. But the best parts of the creative process arise in the spaces between and around each contributor's balliwick. As an actor, I might be standing on stage, tears in my eyes, real emotion filling and pouring out just as the director and author desire - but the magic comes when my fellow actor pats my shoulder and I have to decide if I stay strong and play against the emotion or break down sobbing into their arms. The magic comes from the interplay between actors or creatives.

That sort of work - and it happens in theatre, in art, in design - in all situations where 'makers' or 'creatives' have a place - also requires a huge amount of trust. Creation is a terrifying, brave thing to do. Doing it with someone else - handing them your work and saying 'now do what you think should be done' - is not easy. But it MUST be done, because that is where the magic lives. And hacking is, I think (or perhaps hope) slowly beginning to realize that it needs both collaboration and trust.

## Takeaways

* I find myself thinking of a quote attributed to Ira Glass, even if it doesn't quite apply 100%
> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you wil finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions... It's gonna take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just gotta fight your way through.

# Chapter 3 - What can't we say? 

## Summary
* You should look for the things that are not to be said - the things that Society, for one reason or another, has declared verboten or untrue. Identify them, recognize them - but don't necessarily say them out loud.
* Keep absolute freedom to think - in your own head.

## What Stood Out

* To fight against things that you think should be said but are not permitted is not worth doing unless you truly care about the topic in question. It will eat up your life if you let it.
* Filters are placed upon us for various reasons. Stretch them - at least inside your own mind. That leaves you flexible enough to use and push at those filters when the time comes.

## Questions Unanswered

* I can see where this applies to hacking/programming - but I'm making the leap, the author doesn't seem to be, at least not yet.

## Objections

The premise seems reasonable. But I find myself curious just what his point is. I assume it loops back to hacking - to subtly imply that we should always be questioning how things are done and the status quo. That we should be aware when filters placed on us kick in.

## Takeaways

* Question the things that are not allowed. Challenge convention.
* Mind what is considered permissable today. You can push the boundaries - but it is hard to do. So choose your battles and fight on the ground that matters most.

# Chapter 4 - Good bad attitude

## Summary

* This is a follow-up to the last chapter - applying the concept of 'defying convention and what is allowed' to hackers.
* Hackers are sm

## What Stood Out

* Hackers are smart-alecks.
* The 'hacker' mentality has grown unpopular in recent generations, but it stretches back for a long, long time.
* The Founding Fathers were hackers, their subsequent heirs less-so.
* America - the innovative America - is not a world where people color in the lines.
* Image of Florence of the 1500's (? on year) - it was what New York is today.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

He's generalizing good programmers - implying that only those who constantly color outside the lines will succeed. I can understand the point. But I infer from his argument a call to be contrary and diffucult becuase 'that's how programmers are', and I just can't quite bring myself to agree. There is something sexy and interesting in the hacker mystique, the rebel programmer who doesn't do anything the way they're supposed to. But I don't think he's quite got his finger on the energy.

It's not about being contrary or different. It's about being inspired to do something or make something - and not letting anything get in the way of what you're inspired to do. It's a creative thing - not a defiant thing. The defiance or smart-alec-ness is secondary. You don't HAVE to be a smartass to be a good programmer.

## Takeaways

* Hackers have a (good) bad attitude (sometimes). Generally they are the good ones.
* Hackers don't follow convention. IE: Steve and Woz building computers very different from the ones the big companies made.


# Chapter 5 - The other road ahead

## Summary

* Cloud computing is the future.

## What Stood Out

* Server-based applications allow for easy deployment and updates.
* The assumption seems to be that all computers will always have network access

## Questions Unanswered

* If I run a business whose core functionality is contained in a web app - what happens if my internet goes out for the day? My data is stored on a server somewhere - I can't access it and get things done offline...

* Who owns the data stored on web app's servers? The customer? The company? Moving EVERYTHING to the web app world causes some risks there.

## Objections

* My objections to this chapter are my general objections to the web-app movement. I don't reject it completely - far from that. For some things (like Mint), a web app is the perfect move to make. 

However, that doesn't answer the question of what happens when you are not in a city or place that has access? I can throw any applications and data I want onto my lapotop, step onto a plane, and have full access to everything even if I'm not on a WIFI - capable plane. If everything I do runs out of a web app, then I'd be SOL.

## Takeaways

* Web apps are the future. Be ready. (Technically they are here now...)


# Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

## Summary

* Wealth is having the things you want and need - not necessarily money.
* Startups are earning all the lifetime wealth (and experiencing the lifetime stress) in a few years instead of over an entire career.
* Created wealth does not detract from the wealth of other people.

## What Stood Out

* Hackers are craftsmen who create wealth because their hands are writing the code.
* You as a hacker (or employee) create wealth for the company. Most companies are not set up to take advantage of this fact.
* Measure the value you bring, whenever possible.
* If you're in a job that feels safe, you're not going to get rich. (make strong moves?!?)
* Want to make money? Get past the early start-up phase, be profitable, and get customers. 

## Questions Unanswered

* Startups are a gamble. What about the ones that don't work - what's the loss in value because you spent 4 years stressed and overworked with 16 hour days and only recieved wrinkles and ulcers as your reward?

## Objections

## Takeaways


# Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap

## Summary

* There is a gap between those with wealth and those without, and that's not a bad thing,
* Those who have a lot of wealth got it because they are 'productive' while those without a lot of wealth are 'unproductive'
* The idle rich no longer exist. The rich work - because idleness is boring.

## What Stood Out

* The upper and lower class have disappeared from our society and been replaced by the top and bottom of the middle class.
* More expensive, luxury items used to do the job better than the mass-produced, cheap option. No more. (The only point to buying a custom-made car is to display that you can (!)). Brand, though, still matters.
* In societies where wealth is taxed heavily and re-distributed, things will only be done when they are fun - leaving un fun tasks untouched.

## Questions Unanswered

* The assumption is that wealth is directly proportionate to production. But what ensures that?
* What about the responsibility of people for the society in which they live? Heavier taxation on the rich means that the poor can be taxed a little less, and the money they are taxed goes to support society - things wanted by both the rich and the poor. Good schools to educate workers (adding value to each well-trained worker who will be able to produce more). Police to keep us safe from those who would steal wealth. Fire departments to keep our wealth from burning and hospitals to keep us from dying before we can enjoy our wealth. These are all things that taxes pay for.

## Objections

The author's experience with the rich seems limited to the tech-boom rich. Amid that crowd, one that earned their money, what he says is accurate. But that's not the whole story and it's not the complete picture of the rich.

That's not to say that the rich are all lazy. Not at all. But there are some rich who don't learn to work for what they have, and some who do.

He also seems to imply that so long as you are productive you will be paid relative to your productivity, and therefore those who have more wealth are simply more productive (and perhaps lucky) than those with less. But that assumes a fairness in compensation that does not necessarily exist. If it did exist, then women wouldn't earn approximately 77% what men earn. source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male%E2%80%93female_income_disparity_in_the_United_States)

Also, taxes. See above in unanswered questions.

## Takeaways

* The rich are not evil. They're just more productive.
* An income gap is proof that there are people in society being productive. It is not a sign of a poor economy.


# Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

## Summary

* It's possible to stop spam (!)
* Use statistic-based models and filters rather than looking for specific triggers in content.

## What Stood Out

* False positives become more dangerous as spam filters are more restrictive/the more spam one recieves.
* Whitelists are good for decreasing computation, certainly.

## Questions Unanswered

* What is the current model of spam detection? What makes it bad? It's inferred but never actually explained.

## Objections

* He treats his work as a huge discovery. And it IS pretty interesting. But isn't it just an updated way of recognizing what is an isn't spam? How is this so vastly different from what we've always done - tried to recognize spam and filter it out? Doesn't this just represent the next evolution in spam detection? Which is cool - but not earth-shattering.

## Takeaways

* The next step in spam filtering is statistic-based models that can be modified based on the user's classification of emails as spam or not spam.



# Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers

## Summary

* A basic overview of 'good design'.

## What Stood Out

* Good design is simple! When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
* Good design means a building or object should let you use it as you want - not in the way the architect or product designer programmed it to be used.
* Good design is redesign (AKA iteration?)
* Cultivate dissatisfaction.
* Don't worry about creating a style. If you try to create good things, your own style will emerge. The only style worth having is the one you can't help.
* Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems

## Questions Unanswered

* He addressed symmetry - but not the Golden Mean or rule of 1/3. Touched on it briefly in referencing 'nature' but still. Things that are pleasing to the eye and are NOT symmetical tend to use the golden mean.

## Objections

* None as read. These ideas are repeated many times over in the design community.

## Takeaways

* Good design is simple. Simplicity is hard. But it is also worthwhile.


# Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained

## Summary

* The chapter is a basic rundown of programming languages and their types, the open source movement, and the culture of programmers.

## What Stood Out

* Language levels: Machine language, assembly language, high-level language.
* High-level languages are less specific than the machine language they're translated to.
* What ships to the user is essentially the machine language.
* Languages are not all the same - but many of those who insist one is better than the other say so because they are just used to their 'home' language.

## Questions Unanswered

* How does one choose which language to use, or which qualities are best to use in a language? (and yes, the answer would be to decide what you need to do with the program and pick a language - but I know that because I know it, not because he's clearly saying it out loud)

## Objections

## Takeaways

* There are a lot of languages - and they are tools. Flexibility matters.
* Hackers these days work in high-level languages.



# Chapter 11 - The Hundred-year language.

## Summary

* What language will hackers be working in in 100 years? Will it be something today's hackers could recognize and use?
* Identifies the things that have changed and remained constant in languages.

## What Stood Out

* Languages evolve. Languages that don't evolve will eventually die. IE: Cobol, Java(?)
* The most comfortable language to use is probably a pretty main branch on the tree.
* Good waste is the places where, by spending more, we can get simpler designs.
* Write to try and figure something out, not necessarily knowing where you are going.
* Wasting programmer time is inefficient & gross. Wasting machine time is not.
* Language design by hackers/open source, like Perl, Python, and Ruby.
* The need for efficiency has generally gone down over time, allowing more small languages the freedom to roam.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

## Takeaways

100 years from now programs will still look like programs to our eyes, even if we don't know the language they're written in and the concepts involved have evolved past our easy understanding. So why not write the 100 year language now?


# Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages

## Summary

* Choosing the right language - in the author's case, Lisp - allows you the flexibility you need when creating software.

## What Stood Out

* Programming languages are tools. Everyone (or at least, every computer) speaks them. So why treat one as a dead languages that you'd only use to learn to be a better programmer?
* Choosing the right language, one that was flexible & allowed for fast development, allowed the author's startup to grow in a way necessary for startups to survive.
* Read competitor's job descriptions as a method of evaluating them.

## Questions Unanswered

* At what point does a language go from 'rare' to 'regular'? There are some who'd call Ruby rare - but at the same time, every third job opening seems to want someone with Ruby/Rails experience. So is it now a 'regular' language, or is that position still fast held with C, C++. and Java?

## Objections

* Just because a computer understands a language doesn't mean it's a living language. People - the people you work with when solving the problem - have to speak the langugage too, and to be able to understand how you speak it.

* A lot of this chapter seems to infer that you should seek to use a weird language just for the sake of using a weird language. I'd say you should use the language that best suits the task you are putting before it. You can't control what your competitors understand or do not understand. You can only control your own company and their actions.

## Takeaways

* 'Rare' languages can help you as a startup - which is where you earn money. Uniqueness is good. Flexibility is key. The power of a language is multiplied by the number of competitors who don't get it.

# Chapter 1

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* The chapter is talking about how secondary school is broken. It explains how 
  school is like a prison intended to keep children busy while the adults are at work.
* Nerds are ahead of the game because they want to don't want to play the game 
  being played in secondary school. They want to work on real problems.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that secondary school is a prison intended to keep children busy. 
Since kids don't have real world problems to solve, they resort to popularity
contents. Not having real world things to do extends to college, CS programs
in particular. They are keeping kids busy without teaching them real-world
applications.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Paul Graham doesn't have any ideas on how to fix school. He just says that it's 
broken and good luck going through the current bureaucracy.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

None.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

I want to remember to question everything, even things that I have believed
to be true for a long time. Just because it feels natural, doesn't mean that
it's right.

# Chapter 2

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Disputing that hacking doesn't belong in the computer science field because
  the way we write software is different. Hacking is more like making, writing,
  painting, art.
* Hacking needs a medium that is malleable like painting. He argues for dynamic
  languages or a language that allows us to change as we go. He really is
  talking about agile web development.
* It's important to think about others when writing software because you aren't
  the only person that will be reading it.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that software doesn't belong in computer science. For a while I
believed that there was a disconnect between software and computer science,
that universities were doing it wrong. Professors would tell us to remember
that we are scientists! I have not once in my professional career done
something scientific. I'm a maker of software.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

He talks about how hacking is the new medium that everyone is exploring. I
wonder how often new mediums arise? Is software an outlier?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Graham likes debugging because it's "straightforward", however I don't feel the
same way. Debugging is often harder, at least in my experience, because it 
exposes a problem in your design. It may be harder to fix the bug because of a 
flaw in what you wrote. It tells you about a use-case that you never thought of.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Hacking is in it's infancy and we are being challenged to push what we can do
with computing to it's limits. It is a very exciting time to be a developer.

# Chapter 3

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about ideas coming from places such as moral fashions.
  People have been trained to not question fashionable ideas, however by 
  questioning these beliefs, people can learning intersting things. This is
  true in a business world where a market can emerge from a place where people
  believe something to be true, when in reality it is not true.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea whenever there is something that people believe to be true or is
fashionable, we need to be thinking about why this is and if it is indeed
a truth. We are all taught that we need to question everything however when
it comes to mob mentaility or what is a convention in the industry, we tend
to lose the "question everything" mentality. It is very important to keep
that thought alive.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What in human nature causes people to create these moral fashions?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

None

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

* The quote, "The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, 
  not to say what you want."

# Chapter 4

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Hacking is both a good and bad term describing a quick, dirty solution and an
  elegant solution.
* Graham argues that hackers don't like copywrite laws becuase they prevent
  good ideas from being formed because they are restricting what hackers do to
  learn.
* Government intervention and spying stops innovation, which is what America is
  built upon.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I never thought about GNP per capita vs. a country's civil liberties. It could
possibly be true.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

I wonder if America is on a downward trend to become a country like Florence.
Will America still have it's innovation glory in 100 years? Are other people
thinking about this?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

While I was suprised by his assumption that GNP per capita vs. a country's 
civil liberties would be directly related, I think that is too broad of an
assumption. I feel like there are a lot of reasons why countries do not have a
higher GNP and it is not just what a country's citizens are allowed to do.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

A key takeaway I want to remember is the following quote: 

The spirit of resistance to government," Jefferson wrote, "is so valuable on 
certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive."

A lot of what Graham is writing about is thinking outside of the lines and not
being restricted by boundaries set upon us by institutions, the media, and 
society.

# Chapter 5

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Talks about the success of viaweb and what it took to become a startup that
  was eventually bought about by Yahoo.
* Desktop software vs. Web applications and why the web is the future because
  it lets you move so much faster, contains all of the infrustrcture (clients)
  for you, and why big companies are afraid of it.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that the barrier to business is not that you don't know anything about
business or the competition. These things yoou can figure out as you go. Those
barriers are things that people make up that stop themselves from jumping off
the startup ledge.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Graham talks about what startup life is like and how to make money, however he
never talks about what it really means to be in a startup. I feel like he
explains a magical leap between jumping into startup life and being successful.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I have a disagreement between his argument of web vs. desktop development. He
argues that web development is so much faster and better than desktop apps,
however the reason is that desktop apps are so much more complicated, contain
more features, and do more than web apps can do and this moment. 

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

I want to remember that the reason why startups don't get started is because of
the fake walls that people put up instead of the real reasons that it's a lot
of work.

# Chapter 6

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**
 
 * This chapter explains what wealth is, which isn't money. According to
   Graham, wealth is something that people want. Everyone can create wealth
   especially hackers because they are creators. They create applications that
   people want.
 * This chapter also briefly talks about how to become rich by creating wealth
   and how startups choose what problems they tackle.
 * He also explains wealth in terms of leverage and measurement as a means to
   effectively creating wealth.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that surprised me was that startups choose problems that are so hard
that they are 1) hard to reproduce 2) hard for larger companies to create. This
protects the "wealth" of a startup. I always wondered how VCs decided that an
idea is worth pursing, so it is interesting to get Graham's perspective on his
selection process.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

The unanswered question is how to become part of the 1%. I don't want to say
that it isn't possible, however I want to hear Graham's take on the people that
become part of the top 1% of developers.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I argue about his numbers and assumptions that he is making about the multipier
for startup's, however I understand his point. Everything is not an exact
science in startups and there is always a part left to chance.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Creating wealth is not about creating money, it's about creating products that
people value. Wealth is the creation of things that matter.

# Chapter 7

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about what the gap between the rich and the poor means.
  Graham argues that having a gap means that innovation is happening instead of
  people cheating, stealing or using some other ways of becoming rich. 
* If the gap between rich and poor doesn't exist, it means that people aren't
  creating wealth or are not creating anything that people want. This causes
  stagnation.
* If you want to become rich work on hard problems using technology

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

It was interesting that technology increases the gap in income however bridges
the gap between the way people live.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Everyone that isn't rich believes that they would do something completely
different (i.e not work) if they were millionares. However he says that even
rich people work. My question is if their drive to work is what got them rich
and how they really feel about work after becoming rich.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**
 
I question his argument about rich people creating all types of innovation.
What about rich people that aren't creating wealth. I feel like he is giving a
very broad generalization and is mainly talking about America.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

At least in America, rich people make our lives easier and better with the
wealth that they create.

# Chapter 8

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about a different approach to spam filters. Filtering
  messages based on context as opposed to matching words.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

It was surprising to me that spam companies actually make money. I felt like I
knew that they made money or they wouldn't send spam, however it is still
surprising that people click on their links.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

He notes that he has not updated this chapter so I wonder how people with great
spam filters (Google) attack the spam problem.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He makes his spam filter sound so easy. If it was so easy, why didn't he just
write a spam filter and make more money? It feels like he is oversimplfying the
problem.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Spammers will continue to make money as long as people keep clicking on their
links. That is crazy to me.

# Chapter 9

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Chapter talks about the characteristics of good design. Graham argues that
  good design is something that can be measured.
* Graham also brings up that a lot of great designers tend to happen in chunks
  and it is a bit random where things happen. Things happen where a lot of
  people want to solve intersting problems.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

A surprising idea was that great design looks the same across fields. You would
that design would mean different things, however great design at it's core is
very simple. Everything else that defines great design in it's field is related
to it's core principles.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why are people clumped together in a community solving problems. It feels like
they are drawn to each. That seems like the wrong answer.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I feel like his explanation about what a "great artist" was when we are
children is incorrect. He just throws in what kids probably believe. His
argument is sound, this one does not.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

He brings up the point that people that are great at anything make it seem
easy. It's not that it's easy, it's that they put in so much work that it feels
natural. People's subconcious has taken over easy tasks so their conscious can
focus on solving hard problems.

# Chapter 10

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter is about programming language types: machine langugages and
  high-level languages.
* He also talks about the current language wars: static vs. dynamic typing,
  oop vs. non-oop
* Also he brings up the langugage renaissance, which is the explosion of
  languages that is occuring today.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Nothing surprised me or stood out because I have heard all of these arguments
before.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What is the best language?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Paul Graham believes that OSS is the holy grail of software development. OSS
has it's downfalls mainly that people are not getting paid to do something,
which means that they are not doing it full-time. He even said that for
something to be excellent you need no less than 100% commitment. OSS has both
it's good and bad.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Libraries for a language may be more important that the core language. What a
language allows you to build on top of it is the most important thing.

# Chapter 11

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about what it would take to create a language that would
  be useful 100 years from now.
* Those things are keeping a language simple meaning keeping the constructs of
  the language a small number and taking advantage of the speed of computers in
  the future.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

How wasteful we are today with computer speed. I knew this to be true, however
it was surprising when he said, "I can remember taking all the spaes out of my
Basic programs so they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80". That just
tells us how we skip our thought process around how fast our computers are.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why do we use programming languages as the notation to talk to computers and
why is it safe to assume that we'll be using the same notation 100 years in the
future.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He argues about certain languages need certain criteria and how people are
pigeon-holed into thinking like a language, yet I feel like he is the same way
with LISP.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Whatever langauge we use now or in the future must be easy to use. Any
restrictions imposed on us by the language will need to be stripped away if the
language is meant to be "successful"

# Chapter 12

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about the paradox of developers knowing that their
  language is more powerful that other languages and not knowing which
  languages are more powerful than their own.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That developers don't know when other languages are more powerful than their
own. They view other languages as weird and less powerful.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Based on Graham's paradox, is it true that a language that is more powerful
than Lisp exists and he is unable to see it?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think that his opinion is outdated or for developers that are new to
software. Hackers these days are thrown into a world were they have to use many
different languages to get the job done. If another language has something more
powerful, they can use a language that compiles down to bytecode or compiles it
to another interpreted language. The line between languages are blurring. Even
completely separate languages can pass around data and method calls using
things like protocol buffers.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Use the most powerful language available to you. Language choice matter only in
that it gives you the right tools for the task.

# Chapter 13

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about why Lisp is a superior language and why it's wise to
  use it.
* The features that differentiate Lisp are listed and it's interesting to note
  that the majority of the features of the language created in 1958 are found
  in modern languages.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

A lot of the features in Lisp are present in modern languages. I think the
biggest one that stands out is garbage collection. There have been arguments
that garbage collection was one of the things that increased productivity in
the past 10 years. It's crazy that Lisp already had it.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why did Lisp not become a mainstream language if it has all of these powerful
features?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He explains the power of Lisp based on returning a function, which is probably
too general an idea. I still believe that the power of a language is limted by
the libraries available to it. If a library doesn't exist, you can certainly
make one in the language that you are using.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

That Lisp had everything in a language that I consider to be standard in a
language that I would want to use.

# Chapter 14

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Graham lists what the characteristics of a dream language are: simple, not
  verbose, libraries, open source, good community, quick to prototype, and lots
  of abstractions that make sense to hackers. It has a built in profiler and
  perhaps tells you when you are algorithms are not optimized. If the language
  lets you write inline code to optimize, even better.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That profilers need to be built into the language. I was in the camp that
profilers are addons to a language. Yout always need a profiler, why not build
it into the language?

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does he consider Lisp to be a dream language? I half-expected him to say that
Lisp has almost all of these qualifications.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Committees aren't always a bad thing. I think a lot of great software is
written in the open source community by committee. I think you just need to the
right people on the committee. I mean HTML 5 has a committee.
**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Coming from Java, writing short code that is quick to prototype is a must have
for a language. I have felt this before and now I understand why I felt that
way. I want to just hack on things quickly and not be bothered with all of
the mental startup cost.

# Chapter 15

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* In anything that you hack on, design must be done for users because users
  will say whether what you made was good or not.
* An iterative approach, release early and often, is a successful model and has
  roots in the arts.
* If you design something that you want to use, you often make something
  awesome.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I didn't know that release early and often has roots in the arts. The ability
to constantly refine something is important and it makes so much sense that
it's applicable everywhere.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What other "truths" in the world can be applied to software? Are there any
other art techinques that can be brought to hacking?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't think that you always need to design something that you yourself want
to use. It just makes it easier to design something great.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Release early and often. Worse is better. If you want something to be great,
don't take forever to make it. Users will tell you if it sucks or not.

Chapter 1
Why Nerds Are Unpopular

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd
- Smart kids don't want to be popular
- No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it
- Nerds don't realize it takes work to be popular
- Nerds are unpopular because they have other things to think about
- Children create a crude, savage society for themselves (Lord of the Flies)
- The real world is more hospitable to nerds, because nerds get the right answers
- Nerds clump and create meritocracies in the real world
- Children lack real work, and school serves as more of a prison than an institution for learning
- The mediocrity of American public schools drives kids away from learning
- There is nothing inevitable about the current system, it has come about mostly by default
- School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

Paul Graham states several time that teenagers have little to offer the real world and I disagree wholeheartedly. We seem to have abandoned apprenticeships in the modern age but I can't think of a compelling reason they couldn't be revived.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

What does Graham suggest we do about it? He says that the present educational system seems to have come about by default, but his only suggestion (in a footnote) is to make it more like college. That is hardly actionable.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

In addition to my previous objection to his claim that teenagers are useless, I disagree with Graham's assertion that most adults in education are too apathetic or aloof to affect change in the system. I think a great many people who find themselves in primary education are there because they care deeply, and we need to find better ways to empower them in their efforts.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it
- Being a nerd today is a very different prospect than this, although it mostly rings true for me.



Chapter 2
Hackers and Painters

- Hacking and Painting have a lot in common
- There is no such thing as Computer Science
- Hackers build things using code as their medium, much as a painter uses paint
- What you do and how you do it should not be separated
- The people building the system should also be designing it
- Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry
- Hacking is about making, not implementing
- Static typed languages would be valuable if we knew what we were going to code before we started
- Separating system design from development decreases the standard deviation of the outcome
- If you want to build great software start your own company
- You learn to hack by doing it
- Makers learn by example
- Programs shouldn't work from a concrete specification; the spec should be malleable
- Hacking comes in cycles, sometimes work is fascinating and other times nothing seems interesting

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

I'm not entirely convinced that computer science doesn't exist. I understand Graham's point that generally we call just about anything involving programming computer science and that it is too broad a term, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that computer science doesn't exist.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

What can be done to allow the specification to be owned and implemented by hackers and fulfill the enterprise requirement of a low standard deviation?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Only that I do believe programming in many flavors is in fact a science.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Save bugs for times when motivation decreases to prevent a total halt, and slow down on projects you're excited about to prevent burnout.



Chapter 3
What You Can't Say

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Throughout history we have always considered certain thoughts or topics to be taboo
- We believe things that people in the future will find ridiculous
- Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of your peers? If the answer is no then you most likely just think whatever you're told
- Taboos can be found by looking for specific words; in other times: heresy, defeatist, blasphemy, sacrilege, sexist
- At Harvard in the early 90s it was considered inappropriate to complement a colleaugue or student on their attire
- Most adults give children a deliberately misleading view of the world
- Americans don't need taboos to protect them, nor do the English. Coprophiles are not numerous or energetic enough to enforce taboos and be promoted to a lifestyle
- The greatest sources of moral taboos are power struggles where one side barely has the upper hand
- WWII was a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism, unless you count the USSR among the victors
- Graham explores taboo ideas out of curiosity, and is especially interested in the forbidden
- He does it because it's good for the brain. To do good work you need a brain that can go anywhere
- Natural selection, for example. It's so simple.
- Look for places where conventional wisdom is broken and then try to pry apart the cracks. 
- Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.
- Make a point of encouraging the most outrageous thoughts you can imagine inside your own head.
- Have a few close friends you can say heretical things to
- Disagree with zealots without being specific, or counterattack with metaphor
- Some people use 'negative' or 'destructive' instead of wrong to describe dangerous ideas that are beyond the scope of their open-mindedness
- It is the nature of fashion to be invisible
- Adults have perspective on their own thoughts. Unlike children they are able to examine them at a distance.
- How can you see the wave, when you're the water?

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )  

It doesn't necessarily surprise me that it is difficult to see the wave when you're the water, but I'm not sure I've applied the concept directly to formative thought.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

Why is it necessary to have a brain that can go anywhere in order to do good work? It seems to me that conformists with perfectly average ideas regularly do good work.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Graham states that those who don't have opinions they would be reluctant to express in front of their peers most likely think whatever they're told. I think there are certainly people who are comfortable expressing their views anywhere and anytime who do daring, interesting and thought-leading work. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.
- How can you see the wave, when you're the water?



Chapter 4
Good Bad Attitude

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Hack: ugly solution / brilliant solution
- Intellectual curiosity is a rare motive for crime
- The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas.
- Florence is famous because it used to be like New York
- America is congenial to the right kind of unruliness
- Lately Hackerliness seems to have been frowned upon
- A society in which people can do or say what they want is also a society where the best ideas will win, and the nation will grow wealthy
- Hackers can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

The suggestion that countries find material wealth by adopting civil liberties. There is one quite large counterexample brewing on the other side of the Pacific.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

Why isn't China's economy affected by their lack of civil liberties?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

I don't think that Americans are the only people who think dangerous thoughts, just the most likely to be caught expressing them on an international pulpit.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas
- Hackers can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance
- I hope that good ideas continue to win, but I'm willing to spend the rest of my life battling bad ones



Chapter 5
The Other Road Ahead

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- I think a lot of the next generation of software will be written on this model (web apps)
- It will take about .1sec for a click to get to the web server and back
- Computing is moving to the cloud
- You should expect to be able to test drive any application for free (freemium)
- Developers (in the future) will have to design software so it can be updated without confusing the user
- At Viaweb I doubt we ever had more than 10 known bugs at a time
- Web based software should be less vulnerable to viruses
- Designing web-based software is like designing a city rather than a building
- Some of the Viaweb system was made of a lack of software, because they deleted unix utilities
- When you have competitors, 'you can' means 'you must'
- Many of the failures of desktop software are related to the way it is released
- With web based software there are no versions
- Let the users debug your software
- Since you can diagnose bugs instantly you can find and fix most errors as soon as they appear
- Viaweb never had enough bugs to bother with a tracking system (it was made of pixie dust)
- Functional programming means avoiding side effects
- Viaweb had FREE SUPPORT!!! so they could find bugs and fix them
- Few projects at Viaweb took longer than two weeks
- Shelving an idea costs you all of the ideas that would have popped up if you'd addressed it (as ideas start flowing when you intend to add one item to a todo list)
- Plans are shelved ideas. If you have a good idea, implement it.
- Web-based software requires fewer programmers
- In web development you only need the new product development staff of 13 people, at most
- Adding people to a project tends to slow it down (Mythical Man Month)
- Web applications are never going to be something you write, check-in and go home
- With server-based software you can watch actual users
- In web applications the back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems
- If a user wouldn't have bought your software anyway and uses a pirated copy, you gain, as they help make your software the standard (and will probably buy it someday)
- You'll sell more of something when it's easy to buy; if it's difficult it will affect desire
- You have to be administering the servers; if you give up direct control of the servers you give up most of the advantages of web-based software
- Storing credit card information yourself is the equivalent of keeping your life savings under your mattress and saying it's safer than at the bank because you have direct control
- Outsource any job that isn't directly exposed to competitive pressure
- Some companies will pay more for software because it costs more to sell to them (enterprise)
- VisiCalc was evidence of the evolution in software caused by inexpensive development machines (desktops rather than mainframes)
- Viaweb paid $16k/month for PR
- "If Apple were to grow the iPod into a cell phone with a web browser Microsoft would be in big trouble" - Paul Graham, 2004
- Microsoft will be hampered on the web by trying to save the desktop
- Since web apps never ship you can work 16 hour days forever, and because you can you must if you have competitors
- Programmers are unlikely to dedicate themselves fully unless it is their own company.
- HTML and HTTP are just good enough
- Clients don't matter if you're web-based, the web will continue to work for a long time
- Web applications make the odds significantly better for startups
- Why not start your own company? You know nothing about business and you're afraid of competition; neither of these fences have any current in them.
- Everything you need to know about business: Build something users love and make more than you spend
- You can launch a web-based startup now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair
- Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to use yourself
- Get a version 1.0 (but without the versions?) out fast then continuously improve the software based on user input - MVP
- The best software is easy, but achieve this by getting the correct defaults not limiting users' choices
- Compare your software to what it could be, not to what your competitors build
- Use your own product all the time
- Don't listen to marketing people or designers or product people just because of their job titles
- If you can't design software as well as implement it don't start a startup
- "What's scary about Microsoft is that a company so big can develop software at all. They're like a mountain that can walk."
- Microsoft is scared of you

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

A lot of this chapter seemed like common sense to me, and it took me looking up the publication date of 2004 to understand how prophetic this was at the time. He more or less predicts the development of the iPhone and describes the cloud and web applications quite well.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

- Developers (in the future) will have to design software so it can be updated without confusing the user

This makes perfect sense, and Graham suggests that this is a solved problem without any details.

- In web applications the back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems

I can guess what this means but it would only be a guess unless Graham provides a few details.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- You have to be administering the servers; if you give up direct control of the servers you give up most of the advantages of web-based software. 

Obviously Heroku proved Graham wrong in this case, at least in my opinion. I don't think that modern hackers need to be system administrators, and most of the happiest hackers I know have nothing to do with SA.

Chapter 6
How to Make Wealth

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Why do startups typically work with high technology?
- The time quantum for hacking is very long, so startups have an advantage in uninterruptible time
- A good hacker working without any corporate bullshit should be able to do $3 million worth of work in a year
- "Bulk discount if you buy the economy-sized pain"
- Billionaires are incredibly smart, and incredibly dedicated AND incredibly lucky
- This essay is about how to create wealth and get paid for it; you have to do something people want
- Wealth is not money. Wealth is what you want, money is how you get it.
- If you make violins and none of the local farmers wants one how do you eat?
- Want to find a good idea? Dodge your interests and you are more likely to find something others will need
- Wealth is created everyday. We are not working from a finite pie
- Productivity immediately affects wealth creation, and ranges from negative to millions a month for programmers
- Hackers donate wealth by writing open source software
- Nearly all companies exist to do something people want
- Making something people want is what matters, not joining a group/company
- The biggest problem in large companies is assigning value to everyone's work, they mostly average
- To get rich you need measurement and leverage.
- If there is a big potential for gain there must be a terrifying possibility for loss
- In large groups individual efforts are not recognized, the weak slow the strong and the average member of a large group will be average. Small groups can be extraordinary
- Technology is the technique that makes a startup
- RUN UPSTAIRS
- Startup - n: Working incredibly hard on difficult problems when you are 30 times more productive and barely achieving your goal. 
- At every decision point, take the harder choice.
- A startup is like a mosquito, and a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score
- It is easier to sell an established startup, even at an inflated rate, than an early one
- Get users. Acquiring companies will judge you by how many users you have because they are the best indicator that you have created wealth
- A restaurant can afford to burn the occasional dinner but in a startup you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats
- A startup is, economically, a way of saying I want to work faster for more wealth
- Let the nerds keep their lunch money and you rule the world

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- The time quantum for hacking is very long, so startups have an advantage in uninterruptible time

It honestly didn't occur to me the huge productivity gain that working with a small team in a single office will afford in a startup

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do world governments affect startups when they primarily occupy a global space?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

I think in some respects we are still working from a finite pie, but it is more of a power pie than a wealth pie, and the power is given more opportunity to decide where and how the wealth gets made. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Chapter 7
Mind the Gap

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- In a modern society variation in income is actually a sign of health
- Wealth is created by the people. Children confuse it with money because it is given to them. 
- It does not seem unreasonable the a CEO is worth 100 times the average worker bee
- In a free market prices are determined by what people want, so if we say one type of work is overpaid we are saying people want the wrong things.
- For most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it
- Only after the Industrial Revolution did wealth creation replace corruption as the best way to get rich
- Technology will increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive
- The rate at which technology increases our productivity rate is polynomial
- Brand is the residue as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate
- Idleness is lonely and demoralizing; the rich work anyway
- A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable 
- England had a 98% tax on investment income in 1974
- Henry Ford will make you a tractor to replace your horse if you let him get rich

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- For most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it
I find it interesting that people may create negative associations with wealth as a result

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do we stop the on/off cycle that led England to implement a 98% tax?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Not so much a disagreement as a statement that nothing I read in this chapter explains the fact that we have seen a drastic shift in wealth towards the wealthiest Americans over the last two decades. Is it possible that technology played a role?

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

A Plan for Spam

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Graham did not consider spam a solved problem in 2004
- Bright red is as good an indicator of spam as any pornographic term
- How many points should an email get for having the word sex in it?
- This is the spec for GMail, Graham was clearly not in the beta

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

The fact that this chapter exists surprises me, it is absurdly out of place. 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How does an essay on spam filtering seem so relevant to the discussion of modern computing that it deserves an entire chapter?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

The content is sound, but adds little to the book.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Don't ever include a chapter on spam filtering in my books.



Chapter 9
Taste for Makers

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- How to make beautiful things
- If your job is to design things and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job.
- If taste is just personal preference than everybody is already perfect.
- Good design is timeless
- If something appeals to people from 1500 it will appeal to people in 2500
- To keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortune
- Good design looks easy
- In software a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way
- Good design resembles nature
- Good design is redesign
- Good design can copy
- Good design is often strange
- Good design can happen in chunks
- At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it's nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you're too far removed from one of these centers (move to San Jose)
- Good design is often daring
- It's easier to see ugliness than imagine beauty

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- If something appeals to people from 1500 it will appeal to people in 2500

This warrants a little more explanation. There was a time when cod pieces were quite popular.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

- It's easier to see ugliness than imagine beauty
How is this relevant to original design beyond the incremental improvement of code? When a new algorithm is written and it seems ugly does it preclude beauty in the implementation?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- If taste is just personal preference than everybody is already perfect.

Graham seems to be suggesting that in order for design to be a worthwhile pursuit there much be such a thing as absolute beauty, though I think of good design as catering to popular opinion rather than seeking some ideal. Indeed even the most beautiful things of the last century would have wildly varying degrees of approval today.

Chapter 10
Programming Languages Explained

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Machine/Assembly language
- Machine language is unique to the computer, high-level languages are portable
- When you really need reliability, there are solid business reasons for insisting on open source
- Inexperienced programmers' opinions of other languages are often skewed by their inability to stop thinking in their native language
- A language that lets you do X is at least as good as one that forces you to
- Graham is a duck

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Graham is a duck
I don't know why but I would not have guessed Paul Graham was a duck typing proponent.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

He didn't seem to delve into the interpreted vs. compiled language discussion.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Given that this is more of a factual account than some other chapters I didn't object to anything.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Chapter 11
The Hundred-Year Language

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- We can use present performance to predict languages with staying power
- The language of the future will likely be lazy about preserving resources
- Language design is being taken over by hackers
- Because we can program today as though our hardware doesn't matter, it is concievable that the language we use 100 years from now could be written today

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Language design is being taken over by hackers
I wouldn't have imagined that languages weren't always designed by hackers.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

If the language of the future can be written today why don't we have it already?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- Language design is being taken over by hackers
I think academics can be considered hackers, even the mathematicians, therefore the hackers have always been involved in the creation of languages. There is certainly a distinction to be made here, but I don't like the way he makes it.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- "How to become a Hacker", Eric Raymond
- Some languages are better than others, and startups exploit this
- When you are writing software on your own server you can use whatever language you like
- The Blub Paradox: blub users don't know there are superior options

- The birth of Lisp, John McCarthy and Steve Russell
- Isn't it wiser not to be at the very edge of innovation?

Chapter 14
The Dream Language

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis
- How do languages become popular? 20 is critical mass, but getting there is more difficult than 20-1000
- Whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, it must be popular to be good
- To become popular, a scripting language must be a scripting language of a popular system
- Language implementations must be free, because companies pay for software but hackers don't
- Programming languages must have a book, preferably from O'Reilly
- Greater levels of abstraction mean fewer tokens and less typing. Hackers are lazy.
- Hackability: you must be able to use the language to accomplish whatever you want
- Assume your target user is a genius who will do things you can't anticipate
- A good program language should let hackers do unsavory things
- A language should be good for writing throw away programs
- When people take on a project that is too big they get overwhelmed, the project gets bogged down or the result is sterile and wooden
- A good language needs libraries, future languages may have libraries as well developed as the core itself (sound like ruby?)
- When libraries get too big it may take longer to find the function you need than it does to write it yourself (unless it's on github)
- As Knuth pointed out long ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.
- A good profiler may do more to improve speed than the compiler
- Future languages should provide a way to see bottlenecks in the source, or notify the user at runtime
- Many applications of the future will be IO bound
- Languages need time; most hackers will wait to see if a language survives for a few years before considering it
- The early adopter years are useful to flush out bugs
- Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method
- Languages don't get redesigned often enough
- Hope and worry drive work like two legs on a bicycle
- Language design by committee is a bad idea
- The Dream Language is not only open source, but open design

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis
I would have assumed that all tyrannies claim to be exercised for the good of their victims, but I assume some particularly oppressive tyrants would be happy to voice their malicious intent.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

In Hackability Graham suggests a good language will allow a hacker to do whatever they want; surely some constraints are necessary?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- When libraries get too big it may take longer to find the function you need than it does to write it yourself
Even large libraries today are frequently stored online in very readable formats, so this is probably not the case anymore.

Chapter 15
Design and Research

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- What do you do differently when you treat languages as a design problem rather than a research topic?
- Focus on the user
- Give the users what they need, not necessarily whatever they want
- The design will be best if the designer is also a user (he advised against this earlier)
- Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and some aren't, details for example are hard on humans
- Languages with a toplevel are more convenient and static typing is generally incompatible
- Jane Austen read her novels outloud to her family
- Worse is Better, get a prototype in front of users as quickly as possible MVP
- Morale is key in design
- Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged
- A painting is never finished. You just stop working on it.
- Design means making things for humans, but it's not just the user who is human. The designer is human too

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Give the users what they need, not necessarily whatever they want
This does in fact fit with the idea that the user is always right, given that they can't really be expected to ask for the right thing unless they fully understand their problem.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do you balance morale within a demanding startup environment?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- The design will be best if the designer is also a user (he advised against this earlier)

When looking for software ideas he discourages selections around personal interests as it will most likely cause you to implement what you need, rather than what your users need.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- Jane Austen read her novels outloud to her family

Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular

1) 	- Nerds are unpopular because popularity is not inherent, but rather requires a time and mental commitment that nerds apply elsewhere.
	- One of the causes of this is that school is no longer particularly useful for kids, but is rather a holding pen until their parents are done with work.
2) The idea that stood out to me was placing the blame on the school system. While bullying has often been blamed on schools, it is typically accusing them of a lack of control/discipline over their students. This was the first time that I had seen someone try to correlate bullying with school's lack of usefullness.
3) I thought that the end of the chapter, where Paul said that things could be fixed but that people didn't really care to do so, should have been followed up with how he thought things should be fixed, instead of simply saying that "adults are busy."
4) My main objection was that the bulk of the chapter seemed to be based on Paul's generational experience in schools, and not necessarily how they are today. Specifically, he based much of the chapter on the assumption that all (or almost all) nerds are smart and all popular kids are not. In my experience, there were a great many smart popular kids, and just as many stupid geeky kids.
5) 	- School has devolved from useful apprenticeships to something more like babysitting.
	- For kids in school, popularity is as much about effort as it is about inherent qualities.


Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

1)	- Hackers are more like painters (or other makers) than computer scientists
	- Hackers feel the need to create, continue to learn from others, and often need to satisfy their needs away from their day jobs
2) I was struck by the idea at the end of the chapter that we won't really know for a while the value of hacking, much like we only now know the value of certain artists. To anyone doing any sort of work, the value seems to be apparent in the moment, so it is disconcerting/exciting to think that we may not know as much as we think we do.
3) Paul argues that hackers do not belong in academia, because it does not allow them to do what they really want. Yet there is so much crossover between the two. Are these really all hackers just waiting out their "day jobs", or have some found a way to create while still providing value to the university.
4) I don't particularly object to it, but from the arguments that I have seen over the benefits different team structures in coding, I would imagine many would disagree with his statement that teams should sharply define which module each member is working on.
5)	- Hacking is not a science, but rather an art that depends heavily on knowledge.

Chapter 3 - What You Can't Say

1) 	- Ideas about what is right/wrong have drastically changed over time
	- We have the tendency to assume that the current wisdom is the correct one.
	- It is important to question things, but also equally important to pick your battles.
2) I thought it was interesting that he argued that ideas do not necessarily represent progress, but rather fashion. We tend to think that our opinions are better/'more correct' than previous generations, but there is no reason this actually has to be the case. Perhaps if we considered this possibility more often, people would be more willing to discuss alternative ideas.
3) He advises that, for the most part, if you disagree with ideas you should keep them to yourself. However, most big ideas are not just in your head, they also determine your actions. So, if you disagree with current cultural opinion, it is difficult to keep to yourself without acting in a manner contrary to what you believe.
4) I thought he gave scientists a bit too much credit for pushing the envelope. I believe that most scientists have a strong incentive not to rock the boat too much.
5)	- If everything you believe is what you are supposed to believe, you are probably not thinking enough.

Chapter 4 - Good Attitude, Bad Attitude
1) 	- Hacking is really about intellectual curiosity
	- While restricting civil liberties may protect certain people in the short term, in the long term it will restrict ideas.
2) When I think of America's current attitude toward questionable hacking, I typically think of things like music companies suing teenagers and SOPA. It was suprising to me that Paul praised America's current feelings toward hacking, particularly compared with other countries.
3) How much freedom (i.e. piracy or questionable sharing of content) is too much, even if that freedom promotes innovation?
4) I agreed with most of the chapter, with the cavaet that it is easy to bash all copyright and intellectual property laws without offering an alternative solution.
5)	- Civil liberties are not necessarily an effect of a thriving society, they may also be the cause
	- Restrictive intellectual property laws may protect companies, but they will also squash innovation

Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead
1)	- The future of software will be web-based. Fewer and fewer programs will be installed directly on one's hard drive
	- This structure will create better products, a better customer experience, and will drive innovation.
2) I was struck by the thought that larger companies are more scared of startups than the other way around. So many people worry about what would happen if a Google or Microsoft entered their market, but in reality it is much easier for a small company rethink things on the fly than it would be for one of the giants.
3) Are there any advantages to sticking with non-hosted software?
4) I didn't really disagree with anything in this chapter. Basically, what Paul predicted is exactly what is occuring now.
5)	- Smaller, web-based companies have severe advantages over any sort of large, user-hosted software company
	- Paul Graham nailed this prediction right on the head.

Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth
1)	- A startup is basically choosing to work really hard for a few years, as opposed to working moderately for many years
	- Programmers can create wealth by writing software
	- To achieve the goal of working harder for more money, you need both measurability and leverage
2) I liked that Paul discussed the need for measurability and leverage within a company. I think too many people rely on their ability to work harder for a proportional benefit, without considering if their efforts will be rewarded. I certainly found that when I worked at a company whose employees lacked these characteristics, my motivation was substantially decreased.
3) Is it possible to scale your company while maintaining the ability for employee efforts to be rewarded? I think this is exactly the question that LivingSocial is encountering now.
4) I disagreed with the arguement that you should definitely sell your company. I think the rewards of building many companies are best paid out over time, particularly because most people who sell their company jump right back into another one.
5)	- Wealth can be created, not only distributed.
	- Working harder is certainly worth it, provided you have measurability and leverage.

Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap
1)	- Variability in wealth is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather an indication of incentives to create wealth
	- While technology extends the wealth gap, it decreases the social gap
	- If you switch off ability to create wealth, you switch off innovation
2) I liked the point that saying a certain kind of work is over/underpaid is equivalent to saying that people want the wrong things. I feel like I've often had discussions defending the high pays of athletes etc. based on the principles of supply and demand. Framing it this way, as opposed to just blaming the organizations that pay so much, puts an interesting spin on it.
3) I wonder how Paul would feel about the current most hated group of highly paid individuals: bankers. Would he feel that they too had created their wealth or would he, like many, feel that some of them were closer to stealing wealth.
4) Not directly. I've always taken more a a supply and demand approach toward this topic, which is similar but not the same to his argument.
5)	- The income gap is not something that we should try to avoid, but something that is necessary for innovation

Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam
1)	- Paul proposes filtering spam based on Bayesian probability filters, as opposed to setting up individual rules
2) I like the idea that spam filters could be customized to an individual inbox. I tend to think of most anti-spam/malware software as one-size-fits all, while there is no reason that they shouldn't be individualized.
3) How does this method relate to what Gmail is now doing with guessing which of your emails are important?
4) No. I was a bit suprised at this chapter, because it did not seem to fit with the philisophical tone of the rest of the book.
5)	- Perhaps spam is best dealt with through a machine-learning algorithm
	- If we use this approach, it will actually evolve as spam itself evolves

Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers
1) 	- While many believe that taste is subjective, there is a such thing as good design
	- Good design has consistent qualities, which Paul discusses in turn
2) The idea that one way to create good design is to design for both people now and previous generations was interesting to me. It's something I've never heard before but makes perfect sense. It also, to some degree, explains why so many fashions are retro oriented.
3) Is there a point when good design copies too much?
4) I disagreed with the notion that shorter is necessarily better, particularly in programming. I think that, at a certain point, length must be balanced with clarity.
5) 	- Great design often happens in chunks, when a community of talented people is working on the same problem. Hopefully, this is the sort of community that we are helping to create.

Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained
1)	- Programming languages are on a spectrum of machine level to high level, and have different levels of abstractness and permissions
	- Open source languages have many advantages, including the fact that bugs get fixed much faster
	- Despite what some may say, there are certainly better and worse languages
2) I liked that he said that it was nonsense that all languages are equal. It seems clear that some are better than others, yet there will always be people arguing the contrary.
3) I would have liked to know more about what he thought the future of languages would be. -- Although he sort of answers this in the next chapter
4) I disagreed with the thought that we would definitely be worse off if more people were using the same language. While this may create more roadblocks to innovation, it would help solve many problems (i.e. electronic health records integration).
5)	- A language that allows you do something will always be better than a language that forces you to do it.

Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language
1) 	- As hardware improves, languages will likely make things easier to program at the expense of efficiency
	- The simpler a language is at its core, the more useful it will be
2) I thought that goal of developing a language that was both easy to generate version 1 and had the ability to scale up in optimization was a good way of describing what the ideal language might be. As far as I understand, one of the criticisms of Rails is that it has the first quality, but not the second (although I know many disagree with that).
3) Are there any specific characteristics of current languages that he thinks will or will not be part of future languages?
4) I thought his view that we would not use hardware improvements like parallel processing may not have been giving programmers enough credit. So far, it seems as if every innovation squeezes everything it can out of the hardware available.
5)	- As hardware evolves, we will be able to use languages that are easier for us to write, and harder for the machine to interpret
	- The future of languages is almost certainly in open-source

Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages
1) 	- There is certainly a hierarchy of languages, and Lisp is the most powerful one
	- Lisp was the reason Viaweb was able to beat out its competitors
2) I was suprised that Paul gave Lisp so much credit for Viaweb's success. It seems almost too good to be true the way he described how its power allowed him to write in days what took other companies months.
3) Would Paul still feel so strongly about Lisp if he looked at the menu of programming languages today?
4) I tend to be skeptical when someone says that X is always the best choice, regardless of scenario. I feel that it is much more likely that Lisp is the best tool for some applications, but other languages will allow better and faster development in other situations.
5)  - Lisp is certainly worth examining sometime, if only to understand why it might be advantageous over other languages.

Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds
1)	- New programming languages are only now approaching the level of power that Lisp has
	- Using Lisp allows you to generate programs faster and beat your competitors
2) While I'm not sure I entirely agree with it, I thought it was quite suprising at how differences in languages can lead to enormous differences in production time. This particularly suprised me because I feel like many companies just pick any language, and do not consider the magnitude of their decision.
3) If Lisp is so great, why aren't more people using it? Why do we keep writing new languages that approach it instead?
4) I don't know enough about Lisp or programming languages in general to be sure, but I am always suspicious of an argument that leaves no room for discussions or exceptions. I would bet that there are downsides to using Lisp that Paul is not covering.
5)	- Choosing the correct language for the job can be the difference between you beating your competitors, and your competitors beating you.

Chapter 14 - The Dream Language
1) 	- There are common qualities to any successful language, including succinctness, hackability, and libraries
	- Any new language should offer free implementation, a book, and something to hack
	- New languages take time to be adopted
	- Lays out the characteristics of a dream language
2) The idea that a language must encourage throwaway programs was interesting to me. I had never thought of that before, but it makes perfect sense that a great many projects start as whims, and only eventually evolve into full fledged software. Particularly in the "fail fast" environment of tech today, any language that does not allow fast prototyping is not going to work.
3) How much of the success of a language is determined by these characteristics, and how much is pure luck? It seems to me that many have tried to fulfill these standards, but only a few languages have risen to the top.
4) Paul argues that a good language needs to be part of a platform, and that you should not have to download it specifically. I disagree with this notion, as many people, including myself, have no problem configuring their environment to support a new language if they want to try it.
5) 	- There are common characteristics to any great language
	- Moving forward, the standards for any new language are going to be very high

Chapter 15 - Design and Research
1)	- In designing software, it is imperative to focus on the user
	- Remember that the user is a human, not a machine
	- Stay close to your users throughout the design process
	- Building software that is always working to some degree is much better for morale, leads to a better product
2) I liked that Paul makes the distinction between what the customer needs and what the customer wants. I think that too many people blindly follow the Steve Jobs approach of "I'll tell people what they want", without considering that they still need to adhere to the adage that the customer is always right, just in a different sense.
3) The approach in this chapter seems similar to a Lean Startup approach. Are there any instances where this is not the best way to do things (i.e. where it is better to wait to release the product until it is more refined?)
4) Paul claims that he has never heard of a "Hail Mary" case that worked. I very much doubt that this is the case. A few companies were bound to get lucky, regardless of whether or not they should have been doing things this way.
5)	- Morale is a huge key to the design process. If you are not continually interested in what you are doing, you will not create a great product.

<h1> Chapter 1 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Popularity in high school is painful contest that never lets up
* Being smart isn't the problem, it's that nerds are busy thinking about other things rather than popularity.
* When you don't focus on popularity every second, you are an easy target
* Top of heap doesn't bother bottom because not a threat. It's the lower rungs that really bust their chops. 
* High school is basically just a holding tank slash prison slash older person day care
* Teens learn nothing so they're bored and don't respect elders, adults have no use for kids, so can't relate to the struggles. 

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I was surprised by the cynicism of the author on his outlook on high school. Granted, it is probably more accurate than most would like to admit.  I had a very different school experience.  Found that though I can't remember much of the specifics of high school, I feel I did learn a lot about how to think and analyze. Popularity was an issue, but not as brutal as described by the author.</li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> He talks a lot about finding a solution to this problem, but offers no ideas. It's clear he has some up his sleeve, so it would be nice for him to throw some out there.</li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No full objections, just think its a very bleak outlook on the future of our nation.</li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
* Being smart doesn't cause nerdiness
* Those who pick on nerds are most threatened
* Most would elect to be smart instead of popular if that were the deciding factor




<h1> Chapter 2 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Computer science is the ultimate misnomer
* Creators are creators.  They get better through practice and iteration.
* Scientists recreate work others have done until they get good, then they get original
* Empathy is important, but practicing that doesn't mean you have to ultimately not do what you want
* What sets you art from other coders is the attention to detail. Like the woman with the leaves.

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I was surprised that this chapter wasn't a more widely held opinion in the world.  As a video person, I like to create. Block it out, refine it over time. That's why I felt like this jump would make sense for me. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> No questions unanswered except for how can you revamp the education system, but I also think he has ideas for that as well. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No, I agree with what he says in this chapter wholeheartedly. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Attention to detail. Keep the user in mind. Keep other coders in mind.  </li>




<h1> Chapter 3 </h1>
----------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Fashion changes with the times and so does moral fashion.
* What others fou d taboo in the past, we find acceptable. What we find taboo will probably seem dumb to those in the future.
* How do we figure out what is probably going to change in the future?
* confirmist test. What wouldn't you say in front of peers?
* trouble. What can't you say that is true?
* heresy. What is considered divisive or insensitive?
* time and space. Look at difference in what is taboo here and now vs what is taboo in past or other cultures. Harvard example of complimenting people on clothing.
* prigs. What do you get from subtracting the taboos known by a sheltered teen from a marine who's served all over the world?  Everything you're not supposed to say.
* mechanism. What do bleeding edge people reject first when breaking away from the crowd?
* Why? It's good to break convention, it's like stretching, it will help you think outside the box. 
* Know your audience. Shut up and just think it if necessary, and discuss with trusted friends
* Challenge from afar. Challenge the abstract idea, not the heresy
* Take a look from afar, always question

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I'm surprised that more people aren't doing this.  In a society where everything had to be PC, a teacher can't give a student a high5 for doing something right, it's amazing we can still find a way to interact.  Maybe that's why everyone spends all their time texting and emailing and on the Internet. It's an easy way to cover your bases. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What about things like racism. Sure, looking at the times, we think that slavery is terrible, but I truly don't think that this is a pendulum swinging. This is something that won't revert.  Hopefully other topics become less touchy, though, otherwise we will be a world full of the biggest pansies in history. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Disagreement in answer above referring to racism. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li>Use litmus tests to see if something is a moral trend, ask why, challenge, but don't feel a need to take a stance. Keep it in your head.</li>




<h1> Chapter 4 </h1>
--------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* hackers pre-date computers (safe crackers)
* hacking is American, because it is basically why America was formed

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I'm not very surprised by the fact that hackers like to break rules, and use current technology to build new technology. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This chapter is pretty straight forward.  No questions unanswered.  </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No disagreements </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Key takeaways are that hackers will hack, no matter what the industry and no matter what the times. </li>



<h1> Chapter 5 </h1>
---------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Writing software for browser has many advantages over writing for an OS.
* People deal with more inconveniences than necessary because they think they have to.
* People now realize that no matter what, you should be able to access your data/systems
* Everyone on the same version, bugs fixed in real time, less vulnerability, etc
* Many, many apps are the way to go, not just one large one.
* Releases all the time, instead of once a year.
* Hardware you can choose
* Choose your own programming language
* Bugs found and fixed in real time, weirder the bug, more advanced the user
* Higher morale for innovative people who can get ideas live quickly
* Fewer programmers required
* Watch users helps you find pain points and problem spots
* Server based software benefits everyone, even big corps with lower up front cost, but long term constant subscription revenue
* Great power = great responsibility.  Programmers become sys-ad as well.
* Web browser is good, but only good enough.  Basically the lowest common denominator




### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Was surprised to hear him say that the browser was just good enough.  The common denominator, that isn't perfect, but works well enough to keep using it.  Hadn't thought about it in that mindset before. Also surprised to hear about added responsibility of being programmer and also sys-ad, think this is a great thing and leads to more ownership of projects. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What would be a better common denominator? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Dig this chapter, don't disagree with him.  People are moving to want more control and having a product that is agile and spry to react to needs is a must these days. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> pay attention to what your users want, have problems with 


<h1> Chapter 6 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Startup proposition is to compress your career into a few short years.  All the work, money and time goes into getting it off the ground, rather than spreading it over 30 years.
* "to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain"
* Wealth is what you want.  Money is the tool you use to trade for what you want.
* Distribution of pie is a crap analogy
* Chicks dig dudes who can make things.  Create wealth by creating something.  Not detracting from others piece of the pie.
* Measurement AND Leverage is the key.  Stay small, work hard, get paid more.
* Once you start down the path of startup, you can't stop, competitors will never stop, so you've got to be willing to stay the course the whole way.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I totally understand the use of working fast, but he's got a pretty strong view of it being be fast or die.  Like a shark that can't go under 55 mph or else it will blow up.  Also surprised that purchasers/investors are more interested in users rather than profits etc.  This makes sense now, but I hadn't thought about it that way. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This doesn't have any cliff hangers really </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> not really </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Move quickly, work hard, hope to win the lottery. </li>



<h1> Chapter 7 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* To most, wealth = money.  Esp kids.
* Most of us create wealth for "the man", not ourselves.
* Individual worth is how much people are willing to pay for your skills.
* 100 people can't necessarily replace 1 person, because all the talent is in 1 person, not spread over 100.
* People wary of the rich because often times there is scandal related to how they made their wealth, but that's not the same as creating wealth.  That's stealing it.
* Technology makes it possible to create wealth.  By creating new technology, it gives people the ability to use that to make their own wealth.
* Ability to create wealth waxes and wanes with society and circumstances.

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I think the waves in ability to create wealth are super interesting.  It makes sense that back in the day, you'd only make enough to keep yourself alive, esp if anything on top of that would just get taken away from you.  The more options there are, the more people will explore and create technology.  </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> If wealth is not equal to money, how can we dispel the myths? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> I think this is a purely capitalist view of make your own way.  Not a lot of people are in a place where they can pull themselves up from their own bootstraps.  I am not one for handouts, but limited education in certain areas limits the likelihood that people will be able to use technology to create their own wealth. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Use what you've got to make the best possible scenario for yourself. </li>




<h1> Chapter 8 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Spam filters evolve to knock more spam out, therefore spam evolves to get past the filters.
* More important to get your false positives down to zero than it is to let a few real positives slip past the filter
* Content based filtering allows you to filter on words, colors, phrases, etc and assign probabilities to each email that it's either okay or spam.
* Bayesian method is the way to go.
* Spamming laws would be okay as well.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> How much heavy lifting that math can do.  It's amazing that a calculation can be made on a word's liklihood of spamminess and then it gets filtered out.  My approach would have been the word bank of triggers, but this seems to be the best way to filter.  Also surprised to hear that this guy is interested in limiting spammers with laws and regulations.  He spends a lot of time in other chapters giving the impression that he's not really for things like that.  Make your own wealth, don't work for the man, etc. etc. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Is the Bayesian method what people are using these days?  Why hasn't he implemented this on more accounts than his own?  Sounds like something he should sell to Google if they aren't already doing it. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> None to speak of. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Math is smarter than people, but people have to be smart enough to know which math to implement. </li>




<h1> Chapter 9 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Taste is more important than smarts.
* Good design is often the simplest solution to the problem.
* If there's extra crap in there, it's usually just a distraction for an inelegant solution.
* There are elements that make design inherently good, (symmetry, looks easy, resembles nature, solves the right problem).  
* When groups of people all dedicate time and energy to solving similar problems, you get the best out of the whole group.  It's more than the sum of its parts.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> That one of the hardest things to do is a line drawing of a face.  That good design has sense of humor in it.  Thinking about this now and it feels true.  Even if it doesn't make you laugh, the fact that people are still talking about the Mona Lisa and nobody knows is kind of an amazing chuckle that da Vinci is having from the grave. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> How do we get by with so much bad design?  Why do we keep straying from what works and follow fashion? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> He has a lot of factors in here that make good design, but I think that it's not quite as binary as he is presenting it.  There is definitely a hint of subjectivity that has to go on, because everyone has a different way of interpreting the same problem that the design is trying to fix. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Keep it simple, don't be afraid to start over. </li>





<h1> Chapter 10 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Machine language is what a computer can do.
* More you have to write to get a computer to do something, the easier it is to get bugs.
* High-level languages feed a compiler/interpreter, that translates everything into machine language.
* Lots of debate on which language to use.  

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Not so surprising is that there is no answer other than use the one that works for the project you're working on. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Nothing.  This is kind of a puff chapter.  More of a documentation of the current status of the industry. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> There is no clear winner in languages, they all have strengths and weaknesses. </li>





<h1> Chapter 11 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Lots of languages are branching out and being invented, with varying success.
* Those closer to the trunk of the tree are the ones that will likely be used down the road.
* If you assume that there will be infinite computing power in the future, you could write code that is easier for you, but more inefficient for the computer with almost no side effects.
* Take away the parameters and knowledge of programming, how would you write the program in the future language?
* Could probably create the language of the future today, and steer the way we continue down the road.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I hadn't thought about the fact that Final Cut could run faster and be more if the code was more efficient. I thought it was slow because I was putting in gigantic files and manipulating them to my hearts desire.  But if it were more efficient at a code level, you could do more with less render time and frustration. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Granted, this chapter simplifies the exercise in which you create the language of the future, but isn't this what people are already trying to do with the current languages that are being created?  One would assume that nobody would spend the time to write a language that they didn't think would be used by the community and used for a long time into the future.  With that mindset, what does he think people are trying to do? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Reflecting above question.  I agree that things that will live on in the future will be languages that branch closer to the trunk, but it seems that all the branches started at the trunk and branched for a reason.  On the other hand, technology changes, things become obsolete, that's the nature of evolution. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> In the future, there will be seemingly unlimited processing power, so we'll be able to make it easier for us as programmers, and rely on the computer much more. </li>





<h1> Chapter 12 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* There is a power spectrum of programming languages
* People tend to look down at the less powerful, but can't see what's above them.  Mostly think the top has lots of languages on same level as theirs.
* Lisp is top dog in his view.  It has macros and is dynamically typed.
* Like the comparison to learning Lisp and Latin for sake of enlightenment.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Surprising that he doesn't say it outright.  If it's worth learning just for the enlightenment moment of understanding it.  The enlightenment is that it is the most powerful and therefore should be used.  The proverbial juice is worth the proverbial squeeze, so to speak. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Why aren't more companies using it? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Couldn't he just be falling into the same argument he makes against other languages?  Could he be forgetting to look up the power spectrum and confusing other languages as weird beasts? </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Don't be afraid to learn the hardest thing, if it will then give you the most power in the end. </li>





<h1> Chapter 13 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Lisp was math based, got translated, boom.  Programming language.
* Others get more powerful as they evolve, by getting closer to Lisp.
* Programming language evolution tree forked and is growing back together now.
* Good programmers can squeeze more out of more powerful languages
* At a certain point a language can't reasonably create what a more powerful one can, so it's not worth the time or effort at that point.
* Take on the hardest possible problem and use the most powerful tool to do it.  Recipe for making money.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Pointy hair bosses get away with medicority at an astonishingly high rate! </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What's the entry barrier for learning Lisp?  Must be very high if people are not switching to it. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Not enough knowledge in my aresenal to debate the validity of his arguments. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> To cut down a big tree, use a chain saw, not a hack-saw. </li>




<h1> Chapter 14 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* New languages can be created
* Should listen to what hackers want to make sure it will get used.
* Needs documentation to show how it works.
* Must be free.
* Brevity.
* Let hackers get all up inside it.
* Give it time to percolate and marinate into something people will find delicious.
* Iterate.  Make sure to listen to users to improve. 


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> would be curious to see if this is used as an inspiration piece for people who create languages already. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Does it hold water?  Is it possible to create this dream language? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Not enough knowledge in my aresnal to debate the validity of his argument. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> It takes a long time to get your language off the ground, so be patient and in the lag time make it better by listening to users. </li>





<h1> Chapter 15 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Don't ask people what they do
* Design has to be good, not new.
* Research has to be new, not good.
* If you're designing something, make sure you're included as the end user of the product, that way you'll know it's going to be good.
* Don't get bored.  Design something that's awesome, not something that you think dummies will be able to tolerate.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Comparison of Doctors treating symptoms, rather than treating illness is surprisingly good. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What's his dialect called?  Do people use it?  Is it good? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No, I agree with him about designing something new. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Stay interested, don't generate crap, be excited by designing something that will ultimately make you (the user) better off. </li>

# Chapter 1:

## Summary    
    
* nerds are unpopular in high school, not because they don't want to be, but because they care more about being smart and pursuing higher intellectual goals than being popular.

## What Stood Out

* school is equivalently a prison, or at the tamest, a holding center for young kids
* teenagers/children are cruel by nature

## Questions Unanswered

* none

## Objections

* i don't think that kids are generally THAT cruel, though my memory is foggy. moreover, i disagree with the notion that nerds can't or won't be popular if they don't want to, or that they will be subject to ostracization and punishment from other children, particularly in high school.  i think that the smartest nerds or children can simultaneously achieve a level of popularity that will insulate them from ostracization or bullying but also allow them to achieve their intellectual goals.  i don't believe it's a zero-sum game and i fundamentally believe that nerds, with their unfathomable intelligence CAN navigate the social turmoils of school if they so choose to do so.

## Takeaways

* paul graham seems really, really bitter

---

# Chapter 2: 

## Summary

* hackers are like painters in that they're both "makers" - unlike scientists, mathematicians or other people who work in the more "traditional" roles in computer science

## What Stood Out
> "a great painting has to be better than it has to be" - _Paul Graham_
* the idea that the pursuit of good code is all-consuming.  i agree thoroughly in retrospect, but it's a lesson that i don't think i've yet taken to heart
* leaving bugs for debugging later as you settle into off and on cycles of development
* the battle for innovation is in untested or unclaimed markets, not necessarily within existing castles

## Questions Unanswered
* none 

## Objections
* i have a small contention with the idea that you can't take on microsoft - i think that you can catch larger companies in areas where they're slacking or find holes in their existing software and models and pounce on those as well, not just in emerging or new markets

##Takeaways 
* the pursuit of good code is all-consuming
* have a side project, or something that keeps you hacking outside of your "day job"
* if you want to write truly good, new, or innovative code, start something

---

# Chapter 3: 

## Summary

> "how can you see the wave, when you're in the water?...always be questioning" - _Paul Graham_

## What Stood Out

> "the most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not say what you want" - _Paul Graham_

> "as fashion becomes more established, they'll be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear.  this second group adopts fashion not because they want to stand out but because they are afraid of standing out." - _Paul Graham_

> "i think many interesting heretical thoughts are already formed in our minds. if we turn off our self-censorship temporarily, those thoughts will be the first to emerge" - _Paul Graham_

> "in one culture x is okay, and in another it's considered shocking.  my hypothesis is that the side that's shocked is most likely the side that's wrong." - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* what are paul's radical ideas?  he seems to encourage their exploration, but refuses to espouse many of his own (at least in this chapter)

## Objections 

* none

## Takeaways
* keep questioning, question everything, as objectively as you can

---

# Chapter 4:

## Summary

* "Hackers" have a penchant for disregarding authority, and that penchant in and of itself is a good thing because it's how we best learn or innovate on something old

## What Stood Out

> "they may laugh at the CEO when he talks in corporate newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them that a certain problem can't be solved.  suppress one and you suppress the other" - _Paul Graham_

> "the reason that Florence is famous is because in 1450 it was New York.  in 1450 it was filled with the turbulent and ambitious people you now find in America.  (so i went back to America)" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered 

* none

## Ojections

* i think that his insistence on the sacredness of the word "hacker" is a little bit disturbing, and far-reaching, as well as his affinity for using the term "hacker" to seem to encompass all hackers'/developer's/programmers' mindset, ethos, and overall life opinion as unified

## Takeaways

* if you're going to disobey authority, do it in a way that doesn't disrupt your hacking

---

# Chapter 5:

## Summary

* the future of software and software development is server-based software written to be accessed by users in a web browser.  this type of software is cheap to produce, easy to implement and something that can be tackled faster by small groups and individuals than it can by large companies

## What Stood Out

> "software has to be implemented by hackers who understand design, not designers who know a little bit about software" - _Paul Graham_

> "a big part of what large companies pay extra for is the cost of selling expensive things to them" - _Paul Graham_

> "the test drive was the way that we got nearly all of our new users. i think it will be the same for most web-based applications." - _Paul Graham_

> "investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the future. the truthful answer would have been, we don't have any plans. we had general ideas about things we wanted to improve, but if we knew how, we would have done it already." - _Paul Graham_

> "software companies are sometimes accused of letting users debug their software.  and that's just what i'm advocating" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered 

* the exploration of the fluctuation from mainframe to desktop to server-based software and computing model wasn't nearly as fleshed out or thorough as i'd hoped it'd be; he seemed to chalk it entirely up to visicalc, which seems a little bit short-sighted.  i also think that there IS still a place for desktop software that he's ignoring, or at least that he's glossing over a lot of people's objections to the "cloud" or the server-based model.  i can't say that i uphold those objections, but i think that delving more into why those paradigms still hold true is at the least a good idea if you're truly going to reach people like his mother and convince them that they DON'T need anything but the software you provide them with a web-browser

## Objections

* i was/am a little bit wary that the entirety of what paul's advocating seems to be predicated on his time at or with Viaweb.  we got snapshots of his comparative experience working at other companies, but it seems like this chapter is focused entirely on the successes of Viaweb and little more.  i don't disagree with the model he's espousing outright, but it's hard for me to necessarily take the lessons of one data point (even if said data point was extremely successful) as verboten law

## Takeaways

* web/server-based software is the future, at least according to graham
* start small and scrappy, and be prepared to sink your life into it

---

# Chapter 6:

## Summary

* the creation of wealth is inherently the creation of something that other people want, and that pursuit of wealth itself drives innovation and technological advancement

## What Stood Out
> "the answer may be that Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who had a lot of money to keep it" - _Paul Graham_

> "for potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. the second biggest worry is that if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor" - _Paul Graham_

> "if you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses" - _Paul Graham_

> "to get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things: measurement and leverage...if you're in a job that feels safe, you're not going to get rich because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* none 

## Objections

* this all seems to be pushing a fairly libertarian agenda, or at the least encouraging the pursuit of commercial ends that do not satisfy a need or belief in a greater "public" good.  not that there's much wrong with that for a book or perspective geared towards the idea of writing commercial software.  just observing.

## Takeaways

* wealth is simply what people want
* in order to be put in a position where you control the amount of wealth you want to attain or would like to create, you need leverage and measurement

---

# Chapter 7: 

## Summary

* let the wealthy keep their wealth; variation or disparity in income can be as much of an indicator of societal (or at least entrepreneurial) health as it is of societal ill

## What Stood Out

> "i'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich that he'll hire you as a waiter at his next party.  i'm saying that he'll make you a tractor to replace your horse" - _Paul Graham_

> "i'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates"

> "technology has made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* are multi-million-dollar CEO's and athlete's really being accurately compensated for the "wealth" they generate?  i suppose that they are given a true market economy, and i suppose that my perception of what value sports or certain companies bring to society also clouds my judgment there

* the underlying argument for variation in wealth also seems to be predicated on the idea or assumption that all people have the same or equal opportunity to pursue or achieve the creation of wealth as everyone else does

## Objections 

* again, this seems to be pushing an awfully libertarian agenda. i don't disagree with any of the basic underlying arguments re: wealth generation or the basic reward to people for the services they provide or the wealth that they create, i think it's just farther out in left field than i'm normally comfortable with, more so with respect to my second bullet above in section 3.  i'll accept graham's basic argument that the variation of income or variation of wealth is by and large acceptable and indicative of a "healthy" society, but i think that he needs to critically address the issue of access to opportunity before he can stand on his soapbox and justify the retention of wealth at the cost of purposefully disadvantaging others

## Takeaways

* let the wealthy keep their wealth

---

# Chapter 8: 

## Summary

* Bayesian filters are the best spam filters available
* reducing the efficacy of spam as a marketing tool overall will reduce the amount of spam sent to the point where spammers will have to engage in "legitimate" business in order to remain profitable  

## What Stood Out

> "i used to think it was naive to believe that stricter laws would decrease spam. now i think that while stricter laws may not decrease the amount of spam that spammes send, they can certainly help filters to decrease the amount of spam that recipients actually see." - _Paul Graham_

> "result: if it can't contain exciting sales pitches, spam becomes less effective as a marketing vehicle, and fewer businesses want to use it." - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* none

## Objections

* why is this chapter here, in the middle of what felt like a natural narrative progression based on the previous two chapters?  it felt very weird and out of place, most like graham was taking a narrative or mental break before recomposing his next thoughts - or trying to pitch a new business idea

## Takeaways

* eliminate the efficacy of spam and you eliminate spam altogether
* use a bayesian spam filter


---


# Chapter 9:

## Summary

* good design stems from good taste; taste in turn is an evolving process and one that can't be forced or perceived as "good" until one has a achieved a significant amount of practice and experience 


## What Stood Out

> "but if your job is to desing things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way for you to get better at your job" - _Paul Graham_

> "when you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem.  when you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance" - _Paul Graham_

> "the danger of symmetry, and of repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for original thought" - _Paul Graham_

> "...I don't think it works to cultivate strangeness.  the best that you can do is not to squash it if it starts to appear" - _Paul Graham_


## Questions Unanswered

* how do you actually ACQUIRE taste?  i threw in my personal summation about acquiring good taste through significant amount of practice and experience under section 1 because i was projecting - graham makes a lot of prescriptions about what good taste or form IS, but doesn't actually describe how to go about achieving it


## Objections

* a lot of this chapter is incredibly assertive without throwing a lot of substance or objective proof behind the inherent argument about what 'good' design or taste necessarily is.  

## Takeaways

* good design is elegant, simple, emergent, and thorough.  but i'll be damned if i know how to go about achieving it - you'll know it when you know or see it


---

# Chapter 10:

## Summary

* there are a multitude of programming languages available to programmers to use today, and most program in a high-level language that uses a compiler or interpreter to talk to the computer in assembly or machine-language

## What Stood Out

> "for the little, everyday problems that programmers spend so much of their time solving, libraries are probably more important than the core language. and so these odd hybrids are quite useful, and become correspondingly popular" - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* what are the reasons for programmers/hackers using the languages they do?
* which languages are the most accessible from a learning perspective?  
* which ones are most pervasive in the industry/each industry?  
* how does one actually go about writing a new language, and why would one do that, given the languages and libraries available to programmers today?

## Objections

* another weird and substantively brief chapter. i feel like paul's taking breaks between getting up and down from his pulpit

## Takeaways

> "so it is probably good that programmers live in a post-Babel world.  if we were all using the same language it would probably be the wrong one" - _Paul Graham_

---


# Chapter 11:

## Summary

* in the realm of programming language design, design for the future, as it's within our realm of possibility

## What Stood Out

> "the trend is not merely toward languages being developed as open source projects rather than "research", but towards languages being designed by the application designers who need to use them, rather than by compiler writers" - _Paul Graham_

> "could a programming language go so far as to get rid of numbers as a fundamental data type?" - _Paul Graham_

> "SUVs are gross they're the solution to a gross problem (how to make minivans look more masculine)" - _Paul Graham_


## Questions Unanswered

* what distinguishes a compiler from the language?
* how do you go about writing or creating a new language?
* how do you go about writing or creating a compiler?
* can existing languages be augmented more so by re-writing the compiler as opposed to the language itself?
* is there anything to be said for increasing language interaction now?  or is that a pipe dream/dead end?

## Objections

* purposefully designing a language for implementation or use in one-hundred years seems to be at odds with the espousal of the "emergent" ethos of software development and beauty that graham has previously professed
* i fundamentally don't believe that we have the capacity right now to produce a programming language that will survive or become the 'Hundred-Year' programming language - technology will shift too radically in 100 years for us to anticipate and build that far into the future right now

## Takeaways

* though we might not necessarily be able to design the hundred-year language now, we shouldn't let that hold us back from trying

# Chapter 12:

## Summary

* in order to stay ahead of the competition, always be on the cutting edge of new technology; also, Lisp is the most powerful programming language because it has macros

## What Stood Out

> "so, if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. if not, you're in trouble"

> "no one was leaking news of their features to us. we were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible"

> "i'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement; programming languages vary in power"

> "in a competitive situation, that's an advantage. Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't get it"

## Questions Unanswered

* how much are you biased towards lisp because it's what you know and use?  are macros necessarily all that revolutionary in a programming sense?

## Objections

* i don't think that i have a solid enough programming background to thoroughly and equivocally comment on Graham's praise of Lisp...though I feel like I _should_ at an objective level

## Takeaways

* learn Lisp
* continuously expose yourself to the new things in your field or at least do your best to stay on top of them as much as possible

# Chapter 13:


## Summary

* software languages are multitudinous in their use and implementation, but some are more powerful to use than others.  the distinction between languages and certain language's strengths over others is, however, generally not understood well enough by corporate bosses/managers, or people outside of the "hacking" community
* Lisp is the best and/or most advanced software language ever created, the evolution of all other programming languages tend towards it

## What Stood Out

> "it may also be because if you do add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to have invented a new language, but only a new dialect of Lisp" - _Paul Graham_

> "but if you control the whole system and have the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, you can use whatever languages you want. if any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself" - _Paul Graham_

> "if you start a startup, don't design your product to please VCs or potential acquirers. _design your product to please the users_. if you win the users, everything else will follow. and if you don't, no one will care how comfortably orthodox your technology choices were." - _Paul Graham_

> "when i see patterns in my programs, i consider it a sign of trouble.  the shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that i'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough - often that i'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that i need to write." - _Paul Graham_

## Questions Unanswered

* is Lisp truly the pre-eminent solution to all programming or software writing problems?
* is the pointy-haired boss truly endemic and the only paradigm of middle manager in the software development industry?  how does Graham know that the mythic boss ISN'T pointy-haired and just as much a nerd as him, if not more so?

## Objections

* the only concrete proof of Lisp's greatness that Graham offers up is its simplicity to construct and/or write a single incrementation function; more abstractly, he claims that the least amount of code written is paramount above all else and offers up statistics even he can't verify regarding the dominance and power of Lisp over other languages.  he's not objectively approaching this issue, and it feels to me like a lot of fluff or hot air (especially as a novice or someone approaching programming with very little to no prior experience).  is Lisp really the ideal candidate for all solutions or implementations?  is the non-accessibility of Lisp somehow NOT a barrier to its pre-eminence?  if it truly is the end-all, be-all, why isn't it more widespread?

## Takeaways

* Lisp is the pre-eminent solution to everything programmatically, according to Graham
* Graham hates middle-managers and/or non-nerds

## What Stood Out

> "i think a language has to be popular to be good. and it has to stay popular to stay good." - _Paul Graham_

> "a language also needs to have a book about it. the book should be thin, well-written, and full of good examples. Kernighan and Ritchie's _C Programming Language_ is the ideal here.  at the moment i'd almost say that a languages has to have a book published by O'Reilly. that's becoming the test of mattering to hackers." - _Paul Graham_

> "and so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from" - _Paul Graham_

# Why Nerds are Unpopular
    ### Summary
    Nerds do better in a meritocracy
    
    ### Surprising Idea
    That schools are valueless except as holding pens for children. That teenagers are "useless, except as cheap labor in industries like fast food."

    ### Unanswered
    If the problem is just that nerds don't put as much effort into being popular as they do other endeavors, then why are there so few popular nerds? If it's a skill that can be practiced like any other, why are the split so polarized?

    ### Objection
    I disagree with the points about schools being useless; certainly there is room for improvement but I think the author would find a dramatic difference between students who complete their primary education and those who don't attend at all.

    ### Key Takeaways
    
    * Rebellion is an effect of wanting to distance oneself from the values of a particular group.
    * Being liked and being skillful, while not mutually exclusive, are two completely separate paths to success.

# Hackers and Painters
    ### Summary
    Hackers are more like artists than scientists.

    ### Surprising Idea
    Computer science is too broad an umbrella term. Hackers and the kinds of people who write software for financial institutions and hospitals are so far different that they should actually have different terms for each.

    ### Unanswered
    Should hacking be taught in universities at all? Should there be a Bachelor of Arts as well as a Bachelor of Science for computer programming?

    ### Objection
    A minor nitpick, but I find that certain problems *are* better solved on paper before one gets to a computer. As I constantly remind myself, it's far better to establish what the API should look like on paper first, then start "code-sketching" the methods to support that API.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * To do good work, you have to take the inspiration cycle into account.
    * Debugging, to some, is "as relaxing as painting a wall."
    * Divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner.

# What You Can't Say
    ### Summary
    You should think about what you can't say in polite society, and form your own opinions about it.

    ### Surprising Idea
    That if you think the same things as everyone around you, then it's because you only think what you're told. "It would be like... everyone claiming they had independently decided in 1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea."

    ### Unanswered
    Is it necessarily true that the ability to think shocking thoughts correlates to the ability to think original ones?

    ### Objection
    I think that there are many circumstances in which a collection of members in a society can arrive at the same culturally-unique conclusion independently. Believing the same thing as your peers doesn't necessarily mean that you think what you're told, it could mean that you have a similar pool of experiences to draw from.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * Take no thought for granted. 
    * Understand why you believe what you believe.

# Good Bad Attitude
    ### Summary
     Hackers often break the rules, but in a way that should be acceptable.

    ### Surprising Idea
    If you suppress the ability to think that someone is being ridiculous, you also suppress the ability to think that nothing is impossible.

    ### Unanswered
    Is the fact that something can be done really a moral justification for doing it?

    ### Objection
    I disagree largely with the entire chapter. It's quite possible to be intellectually curious and maintain a healthy respect for society's rules and laws. I don't advocate blindly following leadership, but I don't think that means having to disregard law as a whole.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * Some hackers don't mind giving the culture a reputation for lawlessness.

# The Other Road Ahead
    ### Summary
    Web coding is the same kind of frontier that personal computing was in its genesis.

    ### Surprising Idea
    "What's scary about Microsoft is that a company so big can develop software at all. They're like a mountain that can walk." It seems odd that size becomes a disadvantage, but upon reflection I find that I can see the point.

    ### Unanswered
    Does it work to have a large company broken into small enough units that they can operate as discrete silos? If I have an isolated team of four programmers who only report to one project liason, is that the same as having an entire company of four programmers and one business-thinker?

    ### Objection
    In point of fact, there is more to know about running a business than "make more than you spend." The Penny-Arcade guys, who almost lost their company a decade ago, can attest to the fact that having some business acumen on your side can be a make-or-break difference.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * Somebody out there is making a kickass startup right now. Why isn't it me?
    * In every era, there is a frontier of unexplored territory; the web app environment is one of ours.

# How to Make Wealth
    ### Summary
    There is a difference between earning money and making wealth; you want to do the latter.

    ### Surprising Idea
    That given enough multiplicative modifiers, you could be (for example) 36 times more productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate job. I'm not sure that I could create the same value in one hour that I did in a workweek at any of my previous jobs.

    ### Unanswered
    What on Earth happened with the licensing deal for DOS that made Gates a billionaire? That knowledge is not universal enough knowledge to have gone without a word of explanation.

    ### Objection
    I'm not convinced about the absolute separation of wealth and money. It seems that if I'm in an isolated group of 100 people, and 20 of them want bicycles but only 15 can afford them, and I have the capacity to make 20 bicycles, then my ability to create wealth and my ability to earn money are two separate numbers. I just don't know how that scales to economies of national scale.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * In a small enough group, you can get paid for what you add to the team rather than for being a warm body.
    * Startups are a way to take the value of your output and wager it in a fair-odds casino.

# Mind the Gap
    ### Summary
    Distribution of wealth can be unequal without being unfair.

    ### Surprising Idea
    That a CEO is actually worth 100 times an editorialist (for example). In some way or another it has to be true, otherwise CEOs would not be as highly paid as they are; the only reason I can think of that anybody would *want* to be in charge of so much is because the compensation is quite substantial.

    ### Unanswered
    What does a person (CEO or otherwise) have to do in order to be worth 100 times an "ordinary" employee? Specifically, beyond working hard and being smart, what should *I* do to be worth 100 times the person sitting next to me?

    ### Objection
    I think that there are some pieces where the disparity of wealth between people of dissimilar skillsets can be unjust. I absolutely believe that public school teachers should receive a better salary than bank managers on purely moral grounds.

    ### Key Takeaways
    * A farmer with a tractor is 6 times as productive as one with a plow - if he masters a new kind of farming.
    
# A Plan for Spam
    ### Summary
    Probability-based filtering of spam is remarkably effective.

    ### Surprising Idea
    Nothing in this article was particularly shocking or surprising to me.

    ### Unanswered
    So.... why hasn't he written and distributed this solution? Why can I not, right now, buy this off the shelf (or subscribe to a service that provides it?)

    ### Objection
    I have no objections to anything in this article. It does feel very out of place from the rest of the book so far
    philosophy, philosophy, philosophy, practical solution to a technical problem, philosophy, philosophy....

    ### Key Takeaways
    * Probability: it works.

# Taste for Makers
    ### Summary
    Taste is a skill that can be improved, like any other.

    ### Surprising Idea
    The concept of the Milanese Leonardo caused me to stop and contemplate the implications of that for a while. Who else have we missed out on for all the wrong reasons?

    ### Unanswered
    What is it about Florence that was not true about Milan that made Leonardo? How do we make a 2012 Washington DC that produces the world's best Rubyists?

    ### Objection
    I still think that taste is subjective, and that "improving" ones taste very closely correlates with "anticipating what more people will like". Sometimes I suspect it's "anticipating what thought leaders or conoisseurs will like".

    ### Key Takeaways
    * Maybe you can do great work away from the focal point of your field - but the Milanese Leonardo couldn't.
    * There is no permanent place for ugly things in mathematics. Or, presumably, in computer science.

# Programming Languages Explained
     ### Summary
    Exactly what it says on the tin
    an explanation of what a programming language is and how it works.

     ### Surprising Idea
    While the author didn't touch on this directly, he seemed to imply that an operating system written in a high-level language is feasible. It would be an interesting thought experiment to figure out where Ruby would have trouble being an operating system; it might never be fast but it would certainly be extensible.

     ### Unanswered
    This chapter seemed to be more about answering questions than raising them. 

     ### Objection
    "Surely a language that lets you do x is at least as good as one that forces you to." I don't think that's entirely true, and find it symptomatic of the author's dismissiveness toward rules in general. Sometimes it's nice to know that everything I can possibly deal with in a language will conform to X standard, as opposed to merely being aware of X option.

     ### Key Takeaways
    * If you use a language for long enough, you start to think in it.

# The Hundred-Year Language
     ### Summary
    Using programming languages that are likely to be antecedants of future languages is a good heuristic for figuring out if you're using the best languages of our time.

     ### Surprising Idea
    I'm kind of surprised that the author is casting his predictions about future programming languages in terms of compiler optimizations. To me, the concept of manually setting compiler directives is already kind of archaic; I think that there's going to be a lot less compiled software and a lot more interpreted.

     ### Unanswered
    Why is it inherently better to be near the middle of the evolutionary branch? I can think of a number of tools that are very specific to a problem of its era that are quite efficient at what they do and that will never spawn a descendant. I don't say that it's always better to select the specialized tool, but I'm hardly convinced that the converse is true.

     ### Objection
    I think that object-oriented programming offers plenty to a good programmer. It's very appropriate for modeling things that are, in fact, objects - if I discuss a Card object with a fellow developer as well as a Deck object, the relationship between the two is not only plain but intuitive. It's certainly more than a way to keep spaghetti code organized.

     ### Key Takeaways
     * Wasting programmer time, not computer time, is the true inefficiency.
     * Each layer of interpretation (or abstraction) in a language costs a factor of ten in speed.

# Beating the Averages
     ### Summary
    If you want to be better than the average, that means being proportionally different from the average.

     ### Surprising Idea
    I never thought about it, but it's true that most startups follow a formula - and most startups fail. How can you expect to do the same thing as everyone else and get remarkably better results? It seems like there's even more to be gained by studying failures than there is studying successes.

     ### Unanswered
    A "Powerful" programming language, to me, either means "fast" or "turing-complete". The author is using a different definition that he never actually offers up.
  
     ### Objection
    I don't have any factual basis for disagreeing with his contention that Lisp is the most powerful of all programming languages, and I acknowledge that it would probably be worth my time to at least investigate it and see how it works. But the tone in which the opinion is presented reeks of the very "my pet language is the best language" bias he's trying to caution us against. In trying to avoid "hurt feelings" by not singling out a language, I actually feel like he undermined his own point and simultaneously ruffled my feathers very badly.

     ### Key Takeaways
     * When you write for the web, you can write in any language you want.
     * It's not immediately obvious when you're looking "up" at other languages; often it feels like you're looking sideways.
     * Languages are half technology and half religion.
     * The most harmless competitors are the ones that want Oracle experience in their programmers.
     * Ditto for Java and C++.

# Revenge of the Nerds
    ### Summary
    The author's favorite language is ten times as awesome as your favorite language, unless your favorite language is also Lisp.

     ### Surprising Idea
    What industry best practice actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. I can see where this would be true in certain cases, for a short while. But at least in the open source community, I feel like someone that improves on a best practice resubmits it as the new best practice and it starts to get adopted. At best, I think this is a call to not be complacent with existing best practices; different is not always better.

     ### Unanswered
    I'm starting to think that what he means by "powerful" is "elegant" - he explicitly acknowledges that all turing-complete languages are technically as powerful as each other, but that Lisp is more "powerful" because you can do things in fewer discrete syntactic elements. But he seems to contradict that elsewhere - I do wish that he stated somewhere, plainly, how he defines "powerful" in terms of programming languages.

     ### Objection
    On the one hand, the author stresses the point that not all programming languages are equal, that you should select one where you can find the right talent and get the right job done and that sits in the appropriate place in the power matrix. On the other hand, it's apparently demonstrable fact that since 1958, the correct answer to that question has always been "Lisp". And if you make a programming language as powerful as Lisp, it's because you've made a new dialect of Lisp. Really? And he doesn't think he's got any pet-language bias?

     ### Key Takeaways
    * If there were any takeaways, they were drowned out by the constant fawning over Lisp.

# The Dream Language
     ### Summary
    There is such a thing as an ideal programming language.

     ### Surprising Idea
    I thought it was odd that the author would try to describe a universally ideal medium for all developers. It would be like trying to describe an ideal paint for all artists; there are probably some things that are generally true but I think that a lot of the remainder would be personal preference.

     ### Unanswered
    Why is twenty hackers enough to legitimize a language as real? It seems a low number to me.

     ### Objection 
    The "perfect language" has a whiff of Lisp about it. I wonder why that would be? </sarcasm>

     ### Key Takeaways
    * A programming language without a target (that is, something to hack) is useless.


# Design and Research
     ### Summary
    Design has to be good and research has to be new.
     
     ### Surprising Idea
    That a designer has to interpret their client's needs like a doctor needs to interpret their patients' symptoms. It's an interesting way of looking at it, but I agree with the sentiment.

     ### Unanswered
    If languages are a form for developing programs, and not for finished programs (just as wax is for sketching a sculpture and marble is for finishing it) - does that mean that when a program is finished, it should be translated into a final, more optimized language?

     ### Objection
    I don't find anything particularly contentious in this chapter - I agree with his sentiments on design and research both.

     ### Key Takeaways
    * If you're designing for idiots, you're not designing anything good - even for idiots.

# Why Nerds are Unpopular
	1.	This chapter is about how Paul feels that the reason nerds are unpopular through grade school is because they don't try to be popular. They are more focused on their intellectual ability then what other people think about them.
	2.	Paul's reflection on grade school. It surprised me how stereotypical Paul's school was. Maybe my school was different but we didn't have different ranks of popularity across tables with jocks and cheerleaders. 
	3.	If Paul went back to grade school would he change anything about what he did and would he try to make himself popular?
	4.	This chapter almost sounded whiney and that Paul was trying to justify himself in high school. 
	5.	The key take away from the chapter is that you can only do so many things in a day. You have to choose what matters most to you and from there focus on that.

# Hackers and Painters
	1.	This chapter discusses the similarities between hackers and painters. Paul theorizes that hackers or programmers are more like painters then mathematical people.
	2.	The line drawn between hackers and painters makes me think that there can a line drawn between hacking and anything. Chad often refers to hackers as musicians, which makes me think that more typically programming is becoming an art form.
	3.	If you have to write an algorithm for a math based problem is this still considered painting?
	4.	Just that if you stretch hard enough hacking can relate to anything. Like Chad says hackers are like musicians in composing.
	5.	That while programming you have to remember to just put an outline down and fill in the details and fix things later. Nothing is permanent.

# What You Can't Say
	1.	This chapter is really about Paul analyzing society and trying to discover why people aren't allowed to say certain things. He analyzes the norms and tries to make his own valid opinion about them.
	2.	f
	3.	What would happen if you were to become one of the norms. Is this proposed idea supposed to help an individual be ahead of the curve?
	4.	I agree. I think in order to think differently you have to be able to see the societal way and be able to work around it.
	5.	Don't always follow, but try to lead and react to what people are doing around you.

# Good Bad Attitude
	1.	Hackers hack simply to hack. They like the idea or challenge of someone telling them they can't do something and this is what drives them to build this ability.
	2.	The biggest thing that stood out to me is that hackers just like to cause mayhem. If you look at Lulzsec they hack for the most part simply to just hack.
	3.	What would it take for hackers to simply stop creating DDOS attacks and taking down organizations.
	4.	I agree to an extent. The part about our founders being hackers of their day is a little shifty in that they had a lot more then 20 people behind them and there cause was more just.
	5.	Hackers aren't people with clear cut motives. They are hacking simply to hack sometimes

# The Other Road Ahead
	1.	That web based software is the way the world should move
	2.	This chapter really seems to make the book seem dated. Paul talks about 20,000 users and how applications NEED to be transferred to the internet when really they already are. I
	3.	When the F was this book written? It's so dated at this point.
	4.	No he pretty much predicted the future...
	5.	Why was Bill pictured on page 86 without any mention of why he was arrested? Seemed very awkward. The only relevant thing still in this chapter is that small software companies can sometimes move much faster then say Microsoft can because you don't need to worry about all of the licensing agreements.

# How to Make Wealth
	1.	All a startup means is that I want to work faster and harder then i ever have before in my life and complete 3 - 4 years of work in a about a month.
	2.	That the most valuable thing of an application is the users that have signed up for it.
	3.	How do you get users to sign up for your site and what are potential revenue streams for them
	4.	Even if you work as hard as possible I believe it may not always turn into results especially with a start up. Also building a company to sell is a personal opinion that I disagree with as I would prefer to hold onto my baby.
	5.	Work Work Work

# Mind The Gap
	1.	People are paid so much because they really are that much better at what they do then everyone else. Because of the gap people push themselves harder and harder then ever before.
	2.	How Paul is not talking about the trickle down effect, but the fact that with technology it will eventually allow everyone even the poor to live a much better life style.
	3.	?
	4.	I agree in a sense. It's interesting to look at wealth from a non trickle down but a "Steve Jobs can do more then 100x other people can" therefore he should get paid that much more. He was an irreplaceable asset to the company.
	5.	"I you let Henry Ford get rich he'll make you a tractor to replace your horse" thus making your life better.

# A Plan For Spam
	1.	Paul discusses ways that we can prevent spam from ever making it to our inbox
	2.	How spammers make such a large business off of this model of 15 people per 1 million emails sent. The spammers spend such little time developing the emails and sending them yet the receiving email spends a second per million people and we have a lot of time wasted from a single spam email.
	3.	How does Google and other large companies actually handle spam filtering now?
	4.	No I agree. Spam filtering is very important. 
	5.	That in 2003 people had to worry about this thing called "spam"

# Taste For Makers
	1.	The creation of something new is typically from the recreation of something we have found to be ugly. 
	2.	That our taste buds truly evolve over time and we can create something that we once thought was beautiful and now a day, month, year later we find it hideous.
	3.	How do you physically go about creating something will be beautiful today, 1000 years ago and 1000 years in the future? Paul discusses how Leonardo did this but what about his paintings made this a reality?
	4.	I agree, every time I go to design something I look at the past and recreate from it.
	5.	Recreation of an object is not copying, it is how everything is done.

# Programming Languages Explained
	1.	Programming languages are a form of code built on top of assembly that allow you to write a much simpler piece of code and have your secretary translate it into something they can understand
	2.	Choosing a language should be about what you are trying to achieve however most programmers don't like to leave their language of choice.
	3.	Why wasn't Ruby included in the chapter?
	4.	Yes. Ruby is the best language ever and Paul skipped over it and failed to mention the language entirely.
	5.	Thank God for my compiler that translates everything I write into useable code.

# The Hundred-Year Language
	1.	Paul believes that it is possible today to write a language that will work for one hundred years from now.
	2.	The fact that Paul says hackers are now putting together these languages that people are now using. But who used to put write the language?
	3.	If there was a language that worked one hundred years from now, what would it be?
	4.	I think it is impossible to write a language for one hundred years from now. If you look at Rails it has very predetermined things it is to accomplish. However what if 100 years from now those things are very different then from today?
	5.	Try to write your application such that they work as in far into the future as possible.

# Beating the Averages
	1.	If you are okay with hitting the average of say growing your company 10% a year then you were doomed to go out of business. You should always be ahead of the average.
	2.	I have never heard of LISP before. But it is true, with more powerful software technologies it is much easier to out pace your competition with features
	3.	Does Yahoo Stores still run on LISP? Or have they since converted
	4.	I agree. Picking your tool sets before starting a project is extremely important in the rate of success your project is going to have.
	5.	Look at job descriptions for your competitors and you can slowly figure out where they are taking the company next.
# Revenge of the Nerds
	1.	Use the most common language that will help get your product built and your users will love as fast as possible.
	2.	How your boss is going to tell you to program in language x when really that is just because it is the most popular and what he knows of.
	3.	How do you realistically determine what language you should program in with all of the varieties?
	4.	His statement about how much "shorter" ruby and Lisp are versus other languages is a little skewed.. It tended to look like he tried to make his examples shorter and more concrete then what it actually should have been.
	5.	Choose your language you are going to use before starting the application because the given language is the best at doing what you are trying to accomplish.

# The Dream Language
	1.	Libraries, efficiency, & time all add together to allow a programmer to focus on solely building the application they want to build and not worrying about the language underneath. They should spend no time programming things that could be used for another application and only what is specific to their current application.
	2.	It makes sense to me that I shouldn't have to constantly rebuild the wheel. If you like at Rails a lot of things like authentication, forms, and the most basic parts of the language are either pre-written or have been done before with easy to find and use gems.
	3.	What is the best way to choose what language is complete?
	4.	I agree completely, and this is why I have fallen in love with Ruby. The pure amount of gems is astonishing and can help you achieve anything in seconds.
	5.	"A programming language does need a good implementation of course, and this must be free. Companies will pay but hackers will not, and this is who you need to attract.

# Design and Research
	1.	Build rapid applications as fast as possible with the user in mind. Don't worry about if it is the prettiest or best code in round one just get something out the door.
	2.	The thing that stood out to me the most was the fact that Paul believe Hail marry passes do not work in building software applications. I agree with him in this and have actually gone through a similar circumstance while building an application of my own.
	3.	What is the appropriate amount of time to build an application before releasing it to the public?
	4.	I agree with the concept that always building and having a working prototype is crucial to staying motivated with the application.
	5.	Build fast and don't ever stop building.

###Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular
* Summary
  * The real world is very different from school as a kid, and it can be tough for those who prioritize things desired by the productive real world as opposed to popularity.
* Stood Out
  * I was surprised at the idea that schools are merely a place for parents to drop their kids to stay busy while they do work. I would think that the system would either be smarter than that or people would remove themselves from it in larger percentages if that is the case. Unless everyone is oblivious to this "truth".
* Question Unanswered
  * Although he partially answered how to handle this system as a nerd to make it not as bad, he did not answer a better solution for training people to perform the jobs of today's specialized world. Also he did not answer how to handle being a part of multiple worlds such as being an athlete and a nerd as I was and I'm sure many are.
* Objections
  * I somewhat disagree that playing by all of the rules and shutting your mouth is constantly pushed. Maybe I had different teachers but they seemed to encourage me to think outside of constraints, create change, and stand up for what I believe within the constraints of respect and reason.
  * I also disagree with the premise that all humans are happy working. Some seem to be more content doing nothing.
* Takeaways
  * I want to remember that the reason why people in high school (and I'm finding in the real world) can be so different isn't always based on their inherent abilities, but rather what they prioritize.

###Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters
* Summary
  * People who code/hack are more makers than scientists. There is an art to it and we are in the golden age of exploration.
* Stood out
  * studying other makers is more useful than studying computer science theory. I would think that you have to understand the building blocks fully to be able to implement elegant solutions, but he claims that you only need a certain amount of knowledge of how to use and not necessarily how it all works. This is very contradictory to my computer architecture courses.
* Question Unanswered
  * what differentiates people who become different types of makers and what can each learn from each other aside from making something malleable.
* Objections
  * Beautifully created things aren't always in areas no one wants to explore, sometimes they're in areas no one has yet been able to figure out how to explore properly.
  * Good research is not based on faulty premises even if that allows for a longer explanation.
* Takeaways
  * do work or work for businesses that allow me flexibility to create and solve problems, not just engineer the vision of others
  * start doing some open source work for fun and learning
  * save easy tasks for times when I'm not excited by other work

###Chapter 3 - What you can't say
* Summary
  * most things that are taboo are enforced by those in some power but that feel threatened by the possibility of losing that power. People who are afraid of standing out go along, and these taboos get passed down to children before they have their own experiences.
* Stood out
  * statements that make people the maddest are ones they are worried might be true. Totally makes sense. That's why people have pet peeves for things that they don't like about themselves or dont want to have. I never thought of it this way before, but it's protective as a human. It's threatening and you have to get rid of it so you get angry, the fight response.
* Question Unanswered
  * in psychology we learned that when you say things out loud then in order to decrease cognitive dissonance you start to believe that you feel that way. How do you avoid against that with moral fashions if you are holding what can't be said inside your head only?
* Objections
  * just because something is considered harmless in more cultures than not does not mean that it is not actually bad. That line of thinking is contradictory with his premise that there are times when the majority believes something bad is not bad, e.g. Slavery.
* Takeaways
  * to do great work you need a brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to go. I like the idea of encouraging outside the box thinking even if it's taboo.
  * encourage outrageous thoughts in the head but don't waste time arguing silky things with idiots

###Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude
* Summary
  * what makes hackers and America great is the ability to be slightly rebellious, break rules, and then create something better.
* Stood out
  * the idea that the founding fathers were more like hackers in that they encouraged regulations (government) to constantly be challenged. That rebellious nature is what this country was founded upon and somehow that is now taboo in the eyes of people and what is "American" as defined by politicians is completely different.
* Question Unanswered
  * where do you draw the line? You can't be constantly disagreeing and get along/get things done.
  * if America is becoming totalitarian, where should hackers go?
* Objections
  * he claims basically that any restriction promotes not as good ideas. I'm  not sure that's the case. If you restrict some of what people are working on then we are not going in every which direction, we can have a more defined goal to work towards.
* Takeaways
  * challenge what is taken for granted. It is that mindset that allows you to break through boundaries and create something great.

###Chapter 5 - The other road ahead
* Summary
  * web software is awesome because it allows you the flexibility to be cross-platform, iterate quickly, build inexpensively, and further separate users from needing to know more about how a computer works.
* Stood out
  * piracy is good because it takes people who would never buy the software and makes them users who might buy it later. Interesting take to accept fewer people could pay in the short term for potentially more users in the long term, but potentially the same amount of users in the long term. Have to think about this more as to whether it's actually a good idea.
* Question Unanswered
  * what is the best method of gaining adoption to your software. Sure it has to be useful, but not all useful software gets adopted.
* Objections
  * I am not sure if web based applications are entirely the answer. Many times they can underperform due to either the speed of the users Internet connection or their level of comfortability with the web. I think there are certain programs that must stay as software unfortunately for those reasons.
* Takeaways
  * don't be afraid to start a business because you don't know about business or because of competition. Those are currently as electrical fences.

###Chapter 6 - how to make wealth
* Summary
	* people work harder in small groups and their rewards are more tied to their performance. startups are a great place to work very hard for a couple of years for the potential of making a lot of money. if you can make things that people want, you can create wealth.
* Stood out
  * the first 5-10 employees are the most important in a startup. Makes sense because that's when you shape the direction of the company and those people hire more like them. Interesting to look at how LivingSocial shaped that way, then shaped differently as we had to rapidly hire.
* Question Unanswered
  * if startups are a way to get rich quicker, but they fail more often, over the course of an average person's lifetime do they end up working more time by going the startup route or by going the big company route. Yes one is safer and one is riskier, but in aggregate who wins?
* Objections
  * if you fix an old car and sell it for more you don't expand the pie. There is a fixed amount of money and somewhere down the end of the trail of that money someone has less money for you having gained money. I understand that you may have created extra wealth because you are enabling yourself to enjoy something more by getting money for something you made, but since there is a finite amount of currency you are not creating money.
* Takeaways
  * wealth is what you want out if life, not necessarily money, though it can be a means.
  * vc's pay close attention to barriers to entry in the industry

###Chapter 7 - mind the gap
* Summary
  * societies with high income disparities are economically healthy because that means that some people are being rewarded for generating a lot of worth which is overall good for the inhabitants of the country.
* Stood out
  * worth in terms of what people get paid is what people are willing to spend for their work. it makes sense in theory that people should get paid proportionately to how much worth they bring to the table. i've always heard that if you can do something that few other people can then you will get paid well for it, i guess this fits in line with that.
* Question Unanswered
  * how can a society with high income disparity be healthy if the people at the low end of that disparity can't afford to buy the wealth being sold by the rich manufacturers? Is it the guiding hand or is high income disparity not a sign of a prosperous nation? In todays globalized economy I'm not sure that a few rich people help a country.
* Objections
  * the ceo example does not necessarily make sense in terms of being paid fairly for worth. there are many cases where a ceo simply gets paid more because he was there first or has worked his way up the ladder and has been asked to head up a new company. there are most likely people who create more worth who are paid less. there are probably many people in government for whom my argument applies as well.
* Takeaways
  * since some companies that makes less expensive products make more money, they can focus on design and actually make better products. That's an interesting thought as to the kind of industry that I would potentially want to go into at some point. You can end up making better products that cost less.


###Chapter 8 - A plan for spam
* Summary
  * a personalized spam filter based off of the content of messages is more affective than anything related to the the sender because it can constantly update and adapt. False positives are bad
* Stood out
  * the mind of the spammer. that spamming is a business and they employ some business practices to try to make users interested in their emails and gain money.
* Question Unanswered
  * how do i implement a bayesian filter?
* Objections
  * if i were to implement a spam filter for myself, i would want some sort of seed so that until i have enough content i wouldn't want to receive every spam email.
* Takeaways
  * personalization tasks seems to be the key. if you want something done right for an individual, you have to make it adaptable to that person, not a one-size fits all model because everyone has different preferences, needs, and interactions.

###Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers
* Summary
  * Design can be practiced and cultivated just like anything else. There is such a thing as good design and bad design, and there are certain principles to follow.
* Stood out
  * Good design is strange. It is interesting that the more people experiment and become experts, the more they find strange things about this world that are true. Design follows in suit. Would be interested to learn more about what kinds of strange features make good design.
* Question Unanswered
  * How good is good enough. I understand that it is important to throw away and start again on designs, but at what point is it enough? Where does 80/20 kick in when trying to scale a business?
* Objections
  * While there are some principles that make some design better, there is still some subjectivity. Some people prefer certain colors, shapes, arrangements, etc. That's why e.g. people design their rooms differently, even if they are professional interior designers.
* Takeaways
  * Simple design is important. The base has to be there, then the flashy stuff doesn't matter. It has to be relevant to multiple eras.

###Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained
* Summary
  * there are many different programming languages that vary in how low-high level they are, as well as how object-oriented and dynamic vs static typing they are.
* Stood out
  * we are in a language renaissance or war, where so many are created all the time. I wonder how people create languages, what they see as missing, and how certain languages win out in popularity over others.
* Question Unanswered
  * what languages are best for what purposes?
* Objections
  * from what I've done and seen I don't see the need for low level languages to speed things up especially since computers are so fast now.
* Takeaways
  * learn lots of languages and keep pushing the envelope because everything is changing rapidly. Also don't be afraid of learning a new language since they can have similarities.

###Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language
* Summary
  * programming languages will change dramatically in the next 100 years due to the increase in computing power. there will be fewer languages than now since ideas will converge.
* Stood out
  *
* Question Unanswered
  * what languages currently make the most of fast computers and are the quickest for the user to write? how can those be improved further? in what ways hypothetically could someone write languages in such a way that a user would be able to write code and it would make sense like english?
* Objections
  * while getting farther away from the computer is desirable in terms of getting more people to learn to program, it has the potential to have fewer people understanding truly what is happening through all of the levels of interpretation, as long as it works. that could potentially stunt innovation.
* Takeaways
  * keep learning new languages, they will change as computers get more powerful. push the limits

###Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages
* Summary
  * startups either win big or don't make any money. you have to have a technical advantage in order to outpace your competitors
* Stood out
  * how powerful lisp seems to be. i am intrigued to learn it because of how much he seems to be a proponent for it. if nothing else it might even help me with other languages.
* Question Unanswered
  * how do you know at the start of a startup what language to use. if you use a less popular language for a startup that has the potential to get huge, you may have trouble recruiting. but if you use a more popular language you may not iterate as fast.
* Objections
  * similar to my unanswered question. if you use a not-widely-used language that is powerful for a startup and the startup grows, you may find a shortage of talent to acquire to meet the needs of the company.
* Takeaways
  * learn powerful languages and keep learning, don't get stuck in one language because it seems to have everything i might need.

###Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds
* Summary
  * some languages are superior to others, but this is not readily apparent to people who know nothing about computer languages and which are best for which problem, so instead of learning more about languages, they take the easy route and follow the industry standard, which is not usually optimal.
* Stood out
  * it is upsetting and not surprising that pointy-haired bosses only care about not losing their job. they show loss aversion behavior instead of attempting to achieve gains. similar to most things, we are motivated more by fear of loss than by potential gain.
* Question Unanswered
  * What languages are best for what problems? Can they play nicely together to allow for solving problems with the optimal language?
* Objections
  * lisp doesnt seem better than ruby if ruby does the same thing in the same amount of lines (assuming other examples are similar), looks cleaner, and is more widely adopted.
* Takeaways
  * in a startup write software to please the users and the vcs and acquirers will like you. don't worry about what they want in lieu of what is best for users.

###Chapter 14 - The Dream Language
* Summary
  * the best kind of language offers maximum capabilities with libraries and abstractions that allow minimum effort, but where you can still get into the nitty gritty to change things.
* Stood out
  * the way to make the first 20 (most important) hackers aware of a new language is to give them a program that they want written in a new language so that they get to use it. also it must have online documentation and a book
* Question Unanswered
  * following with the theme of the book that lisp is the best language, why is it the best in comparison to its close counterparts?
* Objections
  * rewriting functional code to make it better is not always optimal when you are trying to scale a business. yes it is great, but it might not be necessary when time is of the essence.
* Takeaways
  * big systems start from throwaway (one purpose, quick to write) programs. write those and evolve them to bigger things instead of trying to tackle something huge. rely on libraries.
  * be optimistic about your ability to solve the problem and pessimistic about your current solution.

###Chapter 15
* Summary
  * when you design anything (including a programming language), don't be like research and try to do something different and novel. first priority should be to make it work for the end user and make it something they need.
* Stood out
  * worse is better. get something in front of the end users as quickly as possible to figure out what will work and what won't. keep working on the initial prototype as time and need allows, but always have something that works
* Question Unanswered
  * when implementing radically new and different things into your prototype, i assume at some point things aren't fully working so that you can make room for the big change. what is the best practice there?
* Objections
  * in some cases it is not best to make users aware of what you are doing early because competitors may get an idea of what you are doing and a headstart on catching up. it might be better in some cases when you have experience with what kinds of things users want to keep a product behind closed doors. it worked for apple.
* Takeaways
  * people don't always know what they need, don't be a short-order cook when making a product. try to see what they need from what they are saying they want

# Hackers and Painters Summary
### - Travis Valentine

## Chapter 1 - Why Nerds Are Unpopular

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Paul Graham wasn't popular in high school and he wouldn't have it any other way.
- Popularity isn't nearly as important as being smart.
- Nerds are better than everyone else.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That he seems to almost dismiss the possibility of someone being smart AND popular, because I think that is one of the sterotypes of anyone smart that he continues by practically demeaning popularity.

That, after all the talk about the ills of everything in life, it is in fact possible for things to be better.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why do nerds and popular people need each other in some situations?

Why all of the emphasis on nerds? I understand the logic behind some of the explanations and validations for their behavior, but if he agrees external factors influence everyone shouldn't there be more common ground presented than there actually is among the classes?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think he gives teenagers way too much credit for the work they put into popularity, making me sort of offended to claim they work harder than Navy Seals.

I find it insuffrable when Graham states that "the thought of average intelligence is unbearable". It just doesn't put me in the best frame of mind for the rest of the book.

On the whole, I understand what he was saying. But I think everyone tries to survive/thrive in their environment in different ways. Some are obviously kinder, more productive, and leave society better; but we all try to do our thing given the circumstances.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- A child's youth is a terrible time. For nerds, it's even more so because they aren't challenged and are forced to fit into a system.
- Paul Graham clearly has a set vision of what he considers to be a nerd. And they are better than anyone else.
- Paul Graham was a nerd. Nerds want to be the smartest in the class and spend their time thinking about things that matter, not trivial things like popularity.
- Anything you want should take full focus.
- Doing things that interest you is better than being subject to whatever else the public education system provides.

## Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Hackers are makers and are best when not confined by a structure imposed by those who don't understand them.
- Hacking takes its cues from other areas of making. 
- Where doing is the best way to learn; there is a relentlessness to creating a great, beautiful product; and collaboration is clear.
- Like other makers before, Hackers find themselves in a defining time period.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That, despite the assertion that Hackers are best without structure, Graham says that structure is the best way to collaborate.

These are the glory days of hacking. I would've considered the early days of computing to be the glory days.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Wouldn't empathy go at odds with what was put forth in Chapter 1, which seemed to be about motivation through a sort of bitter validation?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Not really, this chapter made way more sense to me than the first one.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Bug fixes can be good, but they shouldn't dominate or define a hacking culture.
- Empathy makes a good hacker great.
- Great makers leave a trail for others to build on.
- Great software and great code should make sense and take into account people's points of view.

***

## Chapter 3 - What You Can't Say

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- What might seem ridiculous now, or get you in trouble for saying, might not be as big of a deal in the future.
- To push boundaries, you need to allow yourself to think big.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Again, despite the clear preference of not containing your thoughts, Graham emphasizes restraint. "Pick your battles."

There is a middle ground that is encouraged: don't hold back everything, think heresy, but only express it to a few people. It makes complete sense but I feel as if it goes against his earlier points.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Argue with idiots and you become an idiot. Well, if everyone is encouraged to be - and think - bold, then who is to label others idiots?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't know if it's much of an objection or disagreement as perhaps an unfinished thought, but being withdrawn and allowing observation to inform one's decisions seems at odds with the typical Hacker mantra.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Thinking well beyond the box helps clarify where people will be able to go. And little by little, as you go outside the box, you are deemed innovative.
- The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not necessarily say it.

***

## Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Hacking is a way of life.
- Hackers need access to current technology to help pave the way for future technology.
- Those who break rules are the source of wealth and power in America.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That civil liberties make countries rich. If you believe hackers are the ideal focus group for civil liberties, then they are the most likely to make a country rich. 

That authorities didn't think of the possibility that people could do things out of sheer intellectual curiousity. I never thought how strange it is to think that people might do things just to do them.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Do Hackers make a concerted effort (SOPA aside) to present a rational case that the decisions a Government makes is about competitiveness and the value of good ideas?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't think you can broadly say "hackerliness" seems frowned upon. Sure, hackers don't have the best reputation in some circles but I think it's not so black and white any more. Especially as parts of the hacker mantra seep into other areas.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Be genuine in your disobedience.
- An open society is a better, more effective society.

***

## Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Graham goes through his lessons with Viaweb and reflects on the advantages he had over his competitors.
- The web wins over the desktop on almost every front.
- Startups benefit from the advances in web development.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That big companies fear small startups. I find this tough to believe because, although I get it conceptually, I sometimes assume big companies can be agile.

That web design is purposefully designed to be rapid.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does design factor into the structure of a startup? Today it seems design is just as integral in a startup.

If a web page has to be just good enough, who is to determine whether it is or isn't? And how do they determine that?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The nature of web development is to create things to take the heavy lifting off of a hacker so they can focus. So not every programmer today needs to be a system administrator, unlike they did years ago.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Good software is convenient and not stressful.
- Web-based development wins over desktop development.
- Smaller teams are better.

***

## Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Creating wealth is what you want to do.
- To create wealth, do something people want. And do it fast.

**2. What was one idea that surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That if you look at it at a high-level, work should be framed as doing something another person wants. By making others happy you find a better path to success. This makes sense, I've just never heard it framed that way.

Group sizes are tied to average ability. So a larger group opens itself to the chance of being average on the whole. I just never thought of the dynamics of a group much before.

At every decision point, choose the harder path because it allows you to provide a buffer between the competition. I thought you'd want to do what was easiest given the available resources.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does it go beyond just making something people want? Does it mean more if a few people just love your product as opposed to more that want it? Which is better? Is there a difference?

What happens when a group is entirely made up of great talent? How do you maintain it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The most valuable aspect of a company in an acquisition is the number of its users. I think that's true in some cases, but often you see value in the product early on or perhaps the team. Acquisitions aren't just for users any more, it seems.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- There isn't a fixed pie. You can create more wealth.
- Large groups make one person's value more difficult to measure.
- Allowing people to make money and keep it leads to a more productive, better society.

***

## Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Technology decreases the gap between rich and poor.
- Allowing those who created wealth to keep it is important.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Technology has helped weed out corruption by shifting how wealth is attained, because it helped change the perception of how people obtain wealth.

The value of wealth creation isn't the resulting jobs, but the fringe benefits of the productivity that led to that wealth. The output makes our lives richer.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In an earlier chapter Graham said many hackers are libertarians. Why do the more famous technologists then seem more inclined to a fair tax system that benefits others as well?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I get the point about allowing those who create wealth to keep it, but it seems like most wealthy people past a certain point just stop caring about money. (As long as they can keep some of it.)

By emphasizing the product created by the pursuit of wealth (the example used was the car), you take away from the benefit to society of job creation. I think both of those lead to a better society, so you can't discount the job creation.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- If there is enough demand for something, technology will meet it. And the end result will at least be more convenient than a more expensive option.

***

## Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Bayesian filters will be the most effective at fighting spam.
- Taking a statistical approach is advantageous.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

More laws can help filter spam better. I don't know what surprised me more - the thought of the government intervening and placing restrictions on spammers or Paul Graham being in favor of it.

To beat Bayesian filters, spammers would have to make their mails indestinguishable from ordinary mail. This effectively would constrain them, which proves the effectiveness of statistical filtering.

Sentence 2

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Won't spam extend past just email? There are so many other mediums on which we communicate. Can't spam just go there?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Not really, as I don't know much about statistical filtering or spam.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Constraining spammers will make filtering easier.
- The more spam filters there are, the harder it will be to get through them.

***

## Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Taste isn't relative. There is good taste and bad.
- Good design is much more diffcult to achieve than it seems.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

You can't really force individuality because you naturally find your style by doing things your way.

Working from life isn't just to make a replica. It's to give you something to create.

Design should look easy. If it does, it is likely to be simple. But that means everything was done right, which is hard to achieve.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What are the best ways to evolve one's taste? How do you learn to appreciate great design, particularly if it's simple which can sometimes be easy to overlook.

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't necessarily know that community is as physically important as it was in, say Leonardo's time. Sure communities still exist but they are online. So physical location seems less important. And you can participate passively in a community to help improve your taste.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Suggesting is more engaging than telling.
- Cultivate dissatisfaction.
- Aim for timelessness.
- Don't be afraid to make something pre-existing better.

## Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- There are many different types of languages.
- Higher-level languages are better to program in.
- Bullet 3

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I never knew there was source code and object code. After learning what object code is, it makes sense as to why Windows has made a ton of money.

I didn't know that Java prevented the programmer from doing "dumb stuff", nor did I know most operating systems were written in C. Though that makes sense as to why Java and C are so widely taught.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In terms of open source and more closed systems, what is the true benefit of open source given the success of the iPhone for example?

What's the benefit of creating another language? I get that some just don't do what is needed, but is it better to have 500 languages than say 100?

Why wouldn't someone want to learn/know at least two languages?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Along the lines of my question, while I get the benefit of having numerous languages when is too many overwhelming?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Machine language is everything a computer can do.
- Assembly languages allow for friendlier names.
- Compilers turn high-level language into something the hardware can understand.
- Interpreters are an alternative to compilers.
- Source code is readable. Object code isn't. Well, it's just tougher.
- Dynamic typing allows you to define a variable whenever.
- Static typing is set, preventing bugs and generating code faster.

***

## Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- It's hard to say what language we'll be programming in a hundred years from now, but odds are it'll make programming even easier.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That the notion of strings, integers, arrays, etc. could be gone (or vastly different) in a hundred years. I'm just starting to learn about these, so to think they'll be gone is strange.

Parallelism won't be as pervasive. This surprises me mainly because I can't imagine computers doing anything other than multiple things at once.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why are the languages of today separated from what could potentially be the language in a hundred years? Why are they presented as essentially mutually exclusive?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't really know enough to object.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- The languages of the future will be written by doers, not researchers.
- As machines get faster and better, the key is to reduce inefficiency for programmers not the machines they work on.
- Graham sees object-oriented programming as unbeneficial for good programmers, but essential to large organizations.

## Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Picking the technology that's right for you is important and shows you know what you're doing.
- Lisp can do things other languages can't.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

How central Lisp is to this chapter of the book. I didn't expect this to be such a theme.

You can tell if hackers or hacker culture is engrained in the company by reading job descriptions.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Is it really the language that sets a company apart or the companies use and implementation of that language? See Facebook with PHP, etc.

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

If a language is to be what works best for the hacker, then judging the company off of the language seems less like saying hacker culture doesn't pervade the company as much as the company just makes bad technology decisions.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Your technology stack can set you apart from competitors.
- Read job descriptions of other startups if you want to learn what they are working with.

***

## Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Industry best practice often gets you the average, not the best technology stack.
- Some of the more popular languages today have roots similar to Lisp.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Ruby (and even Python) are similar to Lisp.

Base your technology on what makes the most sense to the users, nobody else, because they are the ones that matter. I would've thought you base your technology on what your company knows best.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

If Lisp is such a great language on top of which other popular ones are based, what does the future hold for it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

No, not really.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- The more demanding an application, the more powerful language you should use.
- The more powerful the language the shorter the program.
- I'm pretty happy to be learning Ruby.

***

## Chapter 14 - The Dream Language

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- A program should be both cleanly designed yet flexible.
- Libraries will be given the same amount of detail as the core language.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Efficiency hasn't mattered much in end-user applications. This is surprising because I feel like we often develop for a least common denominator.

You can be building a language without really knowing it since languages don't start big.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In a language, isn't there a barrier to understanding where things have been made easier for the programmer?

Can open source create the dream language?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Organic growth is better, but yet we focus on who gets VC funding, etc.

Open source will lead to the dream language, yet isn't the open source community sort of like a committee?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Programming languages are good only if hackers like them.
- To become popular a programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular system.
- For a language to be used by big systems it must work for throwaway programs.

***

## Chapter 15 - Design and Research

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Design doesn't have to be new but it has to be good. Research has to be new but it doesn't have to be good.
- Design and research eventually converge at the user.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The customer is right in that design should work for the user, but the user doesn't have to explicitly say what it is they want. It is our job to understand that.

Morale is key to design because you have to feel inspired and be inspired to do inspired work.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What about the users who don't see much utility in the product? How do you factor them into the equation? Just brush them off?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think it's important to understand how a product gets off the ground. For example, I'd be interested to know what functionality would be enough to hook a user group. In some cases I guess one set of functionality is enough but is that the same in others?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- An application should be user-centric.

Horace Williams
Hackers and Painters - Reading Notes
============

Chapter 1
-------------


###1. Summary
True "intelligence" is strongly correlated with a certain type of intellectual creativity which in turn breeds an inherent penchant for non-conformism and interests that surpass the facile topics of mundane/mainstream culture games. This non-conformism and inability to get excited about the rules of everyday social interaction is what accounts for the social stigmatization (but also subsequent success) of so-called "nerds."

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I was surprised that PG seems to believe that "nerdiness" is something inculcated by parents during childhood (by encouraging them to think about stuff etc) - I would have expected it to develop almost in lieu of parental coaching (i.e. what happens when a naturally smart kid is left to develop their )

### 3. What question was unanswered?
How does PG's notion of "nerddom" translate to more contemporary (post-modern?) attitudes about nerdiness - i.e. nerdiness has become increasingly acceptable and even cool in mainstream society __AND__ nerdiness is no longer restricted to 70's/80's/90's nerd pursuits of DnD, etc, but rather is now taken just to mean "extremely deep interest/obsession with a certain topic"
see: http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_angrynerd_geekculture/all/1
see: http://coilhouse.net/2010/12/patton-oswalt-wake-up-geek-culture-time-to-die/

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Isn't this a little petty? Why does a prominent and successful figurehead of Silicon Valley feel the need to begin his treatise on "Programmers for the rest of the world" by appealing to middle school stereotypes? Even if the points may be valid, it seems like the method of presentation actually damages the argument.

__ALSO:__ The experiences described in the chapter are clearly based on a middle-to-upper-middle class suburban lifestyle, and little regard is given to the possibility of other, potentially very different demographic/socioeconomic/geographic experiences.

### 5. Takeaways
   * "Nerdiness" is a prominent-enough social phenomenon that it merits examination beyond grade school assumptions
   * The intellectual abilities that make nerds interesting or successful also make it hard for them to function in the rigid limits of mainstream society
   * Our education system is heavily broken and mostly limits those with actual creativity or intelligence
   * PG is still bitter about being a teenager in suburbia



   Chapter 2
-------------


###1. Summary
As a "creative" discipline, hacking draws heavily from intuitive types of intelligence (creativity, empathy, trial-and-error). The fact that programming is usually eclipsed by Computer Science has led to a misdiagnosis of how to do it well and how to judge its product(i.e. software).

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
PG argues for programming as a "new medium" which is currently undergoing its pioneer years. It's interesting to consider the work of early programmers as analogous to that of early painters (Francesca, Giotto, Duccio, etc.) rather than their scientific contemporaries (Gallileo, Copernicus, Newton etc.)

### 3. What question was unanswered?
It's a little unclear what a work of "Code as Art" would look like. The analogies of programmers to other types of artists/creative types seem pretty good, but it's still the case that most programmers (us included) make their living as a part of some corporate apparatus. Maybe open source is the closest analogy?

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Not much. I'm much more sympathetic to this chapter than the first; in fact I sort of have to be, since he is basically advocating that people from non-scientific backgrounds (like yours truly) can still bring valuable creative intuition to the hacking table.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Hackers are more appropriately grouped with creative disciplines such as painting/architecture etc.
  * Intense concern for details and for "aesthetic" quality is essential to writing good code
  * Most large corporations misuse programming talent by treating them as technicians whose responsibility is to execute product design decisions rather than creative craftspeople who both imagine and execute.


     Chapter 3
-----------------


###1. Summary
Going back to the notion that nerds/hackers are inherently rebellious or non-conformist, PG suggests that a good way to recognize potentially innovative or transformative ideas is to recognize the things that a society tries to stimy. This hinges on the broader idea of "fashions," which PG says can be analyzed fairly objectively in terms of power dynamics

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Despite his prickly (prickish?) attitude on most topics, PG turns out to be fairly conciliatory toward society when it comes to raising objections. I would rather have expected a "man the barricades" type of attitude against social backwardness or conservatism.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
He is not very explicit about how we should best establish metrics for judging cultural fashions. He recognizes that moral and ideological fashions tend to be transient ideas that come in and out of style, but he still seems to think that there are certain "right" answers that you can figure out by thinking about them enough. 

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
This is pretty biased toward a White Male POV. PG seems to think that most "taboos" are fragile constructs thrown up by authorities (whether moral, political, religious, w/e) as a means of controlling a group of people. This is an easy thing to say for someone who has never been in need of protection via social engineering; it seems a bit narrow-minded, especially in the context of a profession that is notorious for its struggles with diversity and harrassment.

### 5. Takeaways
  * As an intelligent person you should seek to mentally question the intellectual or behaviorial barriers that societies put up.
  * Good ways of evaluating a societal fashion or opinion is to challenge it from the perspective of other societies, epochs, or worldviews.
  * Since actively challenging every fashion that confronts you can be cumbersome (or even dangerous), it's more prudent to keep these thoughts to yourself and use them primarily as a tool to hone your thinking abilities.


       Chapter 4
-----------------


###1. Summary
"Hacking" as a discipline favors an attitude of pushing barriers, challenging assumptions, and disobeying directives. These traits are the same ones that have given America a competitive edge in the form of creativity and production, and if society starts to stamp these traits out, it will result in a major productivity disaster for the country.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Great cities or creative centers throughout history (not just in America) are most distinct for their liberal spirit which promotes innovation and creativity. This is as true for industrial/technological innovation as it is for artistic innovation.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
How does the conspicuous success of some anti-establishment hackers prove this as a pattern that works for everyone else? 


### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
It's pretty self-aggrandizing to claim the traits associated with progress as inherent/common to your profession. As usual, there isn't much in the way of circumspection/self-awareness or doubt in the writing.


### 5. Takeaways
  * Challenging tradition/habit is essential to innovation and progress (duh?)
  * Inasmuch as "Americanness" exists, it is exemplified by the rebellious spirit of the early patriots - as well as the rebellious self-sufficiency championed by many hackers


       Chapter 5
-----------------


###1. Summary
The growth of the web as a medium for software distribution has had a beneficial effect on the profession - both because it lowers the barrier for entry and reduces the overhead involved with development, and because the style of working and developing that the web condones is actually more in line with the spirit of hacking and programming in general. The advantages that increasingly allow web-based software to take over from desktop applications are ironically the same as initially allowed desktop computers to take over from old mainframes (they give small developers a way in).

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
It's hard to know for sure whether the benefits PG points out come directly from the web/SaaS model or if it is more a question of a changing mentality (which could theoretically be applied just as well to traditional development). New means of distribution like the App store arguably lower the barrier to entry and the overhead of development while still allowing developers to release in a desktop environment.
*Interesting to see in this chapter the beginning of the "zoom-out" to explaining why startups are the best model for production in general

### 3. What question was unanswered?
After talking at length in the last chapter about hackers as the guardians or "canaries in the coalmine" of privacy infringement, PG doesn't spend much time talking about the privacy implications for moving everything to server-based software.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
The dismissive attitude toward the "non-hackers" involved in producing things is kind of unfortunate - more of the "only programmers can do it right" attitude.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Developers work best when they can strip away the layers of junk that traditionally cluttered most desktop development
  * Web development should be treated not just as a boost to the utility of websites and browser-based consumption but as a shift in the ways that software is developed in general. By giving developers greater control over their environment and reducing the barrier between developers and consumers it ultimately makes for more efficient (and better) software creation.
  * Ironically the ability of web-based software to provide better service for less money actually puts them at a marketing disadvantage (since they can less afford to spend individual attention on major accounts)
  * Putting data & services in the hands of a purpose-specific web startup can actually boost stability and security over self-administered local solutions (thanks to specialization of labor and expertise)


Chapter 6
-----------------


###1. Summary
While money is simply a fabricated system for exchanging value, wealth represents the actual possession of valuable goods. As a productive enterprise, startups are best used to try to creat wealth by introducing new value into the world.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Startups are not just a phenomenon of the dot-com era but rather part of a long tradition of leveraging risk and new technology to produce wealth. Technology turns out to basically mean the "techniques by which wealth is produced."

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Creating wealth by adding value to the world is obviously an admirable goal, but the fact remains that a _huge_ portion of our economy revolves around things other than creating value, so the inequality of wealth can't be simply ascribed to meritocracy.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While PG makes a good point that the quantity of wealth in the world isn't fixed (and thus people getting rich aren't necessarily doing so at the expense of others), it is still true that economic policy (and especially access to education) has a lot to do with the distribution of wealth.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Wealth equates to "economic goods" in the true sense; by bringing more goods into the world, you create more wealth
  * Startups provide a way to create great wealth b/c they give tremendous motivation and reward for performance as well as the means to leverage that motivation into success on a large scale.

Chapter 7
-----------------


###1. Summary
Since wages are determined by supply and demand, in a free market the wage someone is able to earn is actually commensurate to the wealth that they create. Thus it is not surprising that there is huge income inequality. 

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
PG draws a distinction between education and other measures of wealth/social class, when it can pretty easily be shown that these are connected as well.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
In true libertarian fashion, he fails to address the extreme advantages that come from having a lot of money to begin with (i.e. the people best positioned to create wealth were often those who had it to begin with)

PG: People make more money b/c their skills are more valuable, and thus this is not unfair
But: The means of acquiring skills (education) is heavily based on socioeconomic background, and thus there is still unfairness in the system.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
This argument overlooks the reason we treat money differently: it actually impacts your ability to live a healthy & fulfulling life. Being an olympic runner might make you successful, but not being one doesn't necessarily doom you to poverty. Being unable to make a decent living does, however.

Also, a lot of the metaphors in this chapter are based on applying modern class distinctions or ethical perceptions to historical situations, which doesn't necessarily work.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Many people's perception of wealth is colored by the mistaken perception that it is a finite source which should be divided equally (when in fact it is something that can be created)
  * In the past much wealth was acquired through conquest/theft/extortion etc. so it was more understandable that people would object to great fortunes
  * 

Chapter 8
-----------------


###1. Summary
Filtering spam with Bayesian probability filters is much easier and more reliable than using keyword-based filters because it is able to adapt to the individual email account and to the changing habits of the spammers.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Spam is best attacked as a business with a currently-effective economic model, and if you can reduce the effectiveness of that model, you eliminate the ability of spammers to stay afloat.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
uhhhh....where did this come from? One second we were reading about general social principles behind hacking and the economics of wealth, and now we're in the details of techniques for constructing spam filters?

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?


### 5. Takeaways
  * A major concern for spam filtering is avoiding false positives
  * even if a given spam filtering technique doesn't work right off the bat, it can still be helpful by constraining the types of spam that can get past the filter (which in turn makes it easier to design filters for these remaining ones)


Chapter 9
-----------------


###1. Summary
Rather than a subjective, wishy-washy concept, "taste" is a very real thing that is connected to good design. By studying good design and pushing for solutions that have that _je ne sais quoi_, we can improve our taste.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I like the idea that there is a certain universal notion of beauty or elegance which most practitioners try to instill in their work regardless of discipline.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Programming can obviously take a lot from "Less is more" but does it have an aesthetic equivalent of "Less is a bore."

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While I generally agree with the principle, some of the examples are a little oversimplified or stretched, which does make you skeptical. While many of Leonardo's techniques do fit PG's model, there are certainly other great artists who did things completely differently. 

### 5. Takeaways
  * If you find a solution for something that works but isn't the most beautiful, it will eventually be surpassed by someone who can make it functional _and_ beautiful.
  * Good designs give flexible solutions that can adapt to (and even promote) unforeseen uses
  * The development of good taste often comes full-circle to a state of confident imitation or extension of previous work



Chapter 10
-----------------


###1. Summary
Languages funnel instructions to machines. A hierarchy of languages is used to efficiently get instructions down to the hardware while still allowing us to think in relatively human terms and to work more efficiently. Beyond this there are a lot of different languages and at least as many scales of evaluation along which they can be compared.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Just like Jeff said on day one - computer time is cheap and programmer time is expensive (while it used to be the opposite). Thus we get to use nice things like Ruby instead of gross things like Assembly.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
The chapter was interesting and sort of fun, but it would have been cool to get a more extensive summary of the broad philosophies behind a handful of popular languages - an ethnography of sorts of the current language landscape.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
He didn't talk about ruby? :(

### 5. Takeaways
  * Most languages can be used to accomplish roughly the same tasks, but you still want to be sensitive to choosing the right tool for the job.
  * Like most areas of computer tech, the cheapening of hardware has led to a great proliferation in new languages (as practically anyone now has the means to write one).


Chapter 11
-----------------


###1. Summary
Programming languages are an ever-changing field of inquiry and their ongoing development can be traced similarly to organic evolution. By looking at the types of languages that have proved successful and the types that have died out, we can learn lessons about what makes a good language and how to better design new ones. Assuming that programming will be roughly the same discipline in 100 yrs as now, we can expect that languages in 100 years will still need to meet 2 challenges: make things easy and run efficiently when necessary. Since being able to run efficiently is a prerequisite, we could presumably use such a language today (even if we had to do lots of optimizing to it). This produces the better mindset of aiming where we want to go in the long term rather than where we want to go in the near future.
  * "One way to design a language is to just write down the program you'd like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it."

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I really liked the explanation of languages based on "fundamental operators" and "everything else." The idea of coming up with an elegant but flexible set of fundamental instructions is a really interesting design problem, and it's interesting to consider the ways in which a languages broader tendencies follow formally from the basic underlying instructions.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
PG guesses that even in 100 years we still won't be able to "just tell computers what we want them to do" because there hasn't been much progress thus far. But really? _All_the progress that has ever been made on computers - period - dates to about 60 years ago, and most signs indicate it has been speeding up during that time. So this seems like an unreliable way to diagnose what will be possible 100 years from now.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While the notion of "stay on a main branch" obviously makes some sense for language design, it sort of seems counter to the antiestablishment spirit of innovation championed in earlier chapters. It seems like the branches of languages that die out are still incredibly important for the lessons that they teach the discipline as a whole.

### 5. Takeaways
  * The design of languages follows the patterns outlined in ch. 9 - A good way to design something good is to try to think of something timeless 
  * A good way to understand a language is to look at its underlying principles
  * Generally, these should be made as simple and few as possible
  * As hardware continues to get faster, there will be good ways to use the extra speed and bad ways - a good way is to take advantage of it to improve the elegance of our language and software designs (another case of people time being more valuable than computer time)


Chapter 12
-----------------


###1. Summary
Programming languages should be examined from the perspective of overall power and abstractness (rather than specific featuresets). Lisp turns out to be an extremely powerful language because of XXX, and because of this, it can be reliably used to produce great applications, even if this is not a common use for it. 

### 2. What stood out or surprised?


### 3. What question was unanswered?
How can you really claim to prove one language to be "most powerful"? Maybe this is sarcasm? The problem is the same as what PG identifies with the analogy of the language continuum - it's always hard to perceive those things that are higher up than you are, so if there is something higher than Lisp, how will he be able to know he isn't just missing it because Lisp is his favorite.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
PG's assumption that since Lisp supposedly makes you a better programmer, it should also result in better programs isn't really accurate to what the other sources are saying. When Eric Raymond says Lisp will teach you things but you won't actually use it, this is because the things that make a language educational and the things that make it useful aren't necessarily the same. PG's argument seems to conflate these 2 things.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Startups rely more on technological edge than traditional companies, and thus need to be more keenly aware of choosing the best tool for the job
  * Programmers are very habitual and hidebound when it comes to language selection; it is important to be on the lookout for new developments and try not to let yourself get stuck in a rut


Chapter 13
-----------------


###1. Summary
The main features that all programming languages eventually evolve toward are abstraction and flexibility (in terms of the language itself, not just the availability of libraries, etc.) Ironically, Lisp, because of its unusual origins, was very well-designed to meet these goals all the way back in 1958, and has just been waiting for a chance to get into mainstream use. Meanwhile, other languages have slowly evolved to incorporate many of the features that Lisp originally introduced.


### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Didn't realize ruby was somewhat lisp-like (at least according to PG). It seems like this similarity comes from the way Ruby handles blocks? A block is like a function that can be evaluated in-line without having to be defined with explicit returns?

### 3. What question was unanswered?
What is the difference between writing macros and metaprogramming in Ruby? I guess i need a more noob-friendly intro to macros...

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
It's still not that clear why Lisp never really got used if it is so great. Part of PG's argument is that even the first Lisp from 1958 basically had the features that make the language great, but if that's the case why did it take people 50 years to realize it? Is this just because it is hard?

### 5. Takeaways
  * Lisp's power comes from the fact that it was developed as a mathematical exercise rather than a programming language, and other languages have slowly been incorporating some of its ideas (becoming more Lisp-like)
  * The advantages of using powerful languages are obvious - they let you solve more complex problems; the disadvantages, however, are more circumstantial - and are disappearing in the age of web applications


Chapter 14
-----------------

###1. Summary
While there are a lot of extraneous and conflicting factors that determine the success of languages, what matters most is how useful they are to actual programmers. At the end of the day (or given enough time) the better languages probably do rise to the top. The factors that accelerate this are their distribution and their usefulness for solving a common problem. Beyond this, succinctness and the ability to accomplish what we want make our lives easier and, all else being equal, lead to greater adoption.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Abstractions aren't necessarily things that get a language closer to English - they simply make something conceptually more elegant, which can theoretically be expressed in any syntax so long as it is short and relatively simple.


### 3. What question was unanswered?


### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While I pretty much agree, I do think a certain amount of explicitness and boilerplate helps guide the brain along the same track as the language. Maybe this is just a beginner's impulse that will fade over time.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Languages become popular by a) being good and b) being the de facto tool for working in a certain system; a language that can do both of these will probably be successful
  * The best languages will be designed to give the user freedom to discover things that the designer couldn't think of - rather than to try to protect him from what the designer perceives as dangerous
  * +1 for Ruby - letting programmers override inherent functionality of the language adds tremendous freedom, even if it is used sparingly
  * speed only matters in the bottlenecks - so the way to make something fast is to provide the tools for identifying the bottlenecks rather than trying to change the whole thing for the sake of a handfull of situations.


Chapter 15
-----------------

###1. Summary
Research and design represent two "forks" on the path to progress. Design is more concerned with making things work for people, and since programming languages need to work for people, they have a lot to learn from the design process. Specifically, this means thinking about things ergonomically from the perspective of the users and working iteratively to improve on solutions.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Interesting that he starts to group programming with the Arts. I like it.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
The idea of approaching programming in this way makes total sense to me, so I wish there had been more discussion of why the discipline is generally perceived as the domain of "science-nerds." (no offense to said nerds)

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Like some of the other chapters, I totally agree with the sentiment but I think the obsession with surface-level metaphors weakens the argument. I would rather have seen him dive into some deeper analysis of why/how iteration works from a conceptual/philosophical level than have more pithy one-liners about oil paint/marble/whatever.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Research & Design can achieve similar results but with different processes
  * While many people consider "design" as the aesthetic enterprise of making things look good, it actually has more to do with an analytical and iterative approach to problem solving from a human-centric perspective (_ArchitectRant: This word actually comes from the Italian word for "drawing" (_Disegnio_, or something like that, and it originated during the Renaissance when the study of perspective system ))

1.  
US public schools are holding pens for adolesents that breed boredom and cruelty.  
Nerds aren't popular because they have better things to do.  

2. 
The idea that high school students have an elaborate caste system is surprising. The author seemed to think that popularity was both caused by being complacent and by actively working toward being popular. These conflicting ideas weren't resolved.

3. 
The author made broad claims about high school students' caste systems, popular students' disinterest in learning, the lack of involvement by adults in students' lives, and the uselessness of high school. Do other types of learning environments exist? He never tries to disprove his own personal experience.

4. 
His idea that student popularity is caused by caring more about popularity than about other things, and that popularity is based on a certain set of criteria is not absolute. My high school experience was awesome. I felt neither popular nor unpopular and the adults in my life were actively engaged in seeing me succeed, academically and beyond.

5. 
Some nerds were bullied heavily in school and didn't find productive things to do.

1.  
Hackers are more like painters (makers) than engineers (implementers).
There is nuance and art to writing software.  

2. 
The author said to "...fight design wars in new markets," after explaining why large companies create bad software. It seems as if there's a tremendous amount to be gained by creating beautiful software that replaces existing crappy software written by large teams.

3. 
Why is knowing theory irrelevant? I understand that practice and application are extremely important to writing code, but it seems that knowing how systems are implemented to be efficient, and knowing about coding practices, is also valuable.

4. 
I've heard arguments against this, particularly related to diversity and championing women who care for families and take on a larger number of domestic duties than men. I think contribution to open source is not the primary identifier of love of software and that idea should be revamped.

5. 
Hackers start original, and get good, while scientists start good and get original. 
Hacking, like painting, is done through gradual refinement. 
Empathy for the user is crucial in creating great software.

1.  
Moral fashion should be considered and consciously avoided.

2. 
The author states that moral issues are binary - you can ask whether something's true. Heretics think that common ideas are false. I believe that all moral issues are relative, so thinking that a pervasive moral idea is universally false seems really odd.

3. 
What kinds of issues is the author talking about? The author is condemning popular morality, but doesn't share his views on specific topics.

4. 
 His ideas of universal versus relative seem strange. He says that murder is universally wrong, though, but throughout history murder has had varying popular views. 

5. 
Critically think about the popular moral code and come up with your own opinions you can share with a close group of friends.

1.  
Disobedience is at the center of creativity and is very "American."
Hacks, both elegant and ugly, break the rules.

2. 
Civil liberties lead to innovation and prosperity. Having less imposed means we can figure out what exists today and improve upon it.  

3.  
How do we delineate ugly hacking and groundbreaking hacking, other than with our existing biases?  

4. 
The last paragraph about rule setting didn't make sense. To whom is he referring with "...be careful what you ask for. You might get it." 

5. 
Dig into what exists to learn and get ideas.
Be wary of artificial restrictions.

1.  
Web-based applications are superior to desktop applications because they can be implemented and improved rapidly, taking the customer into account.

2.  
Large companies are frightened of software startups. They can't implement as rapidly and aren't as productive.

3.  
The least technical users are the ones that need web-based software the most but they're the slowest to change. How will this be addressed?

4.  
I am not sure I agree with total ownership of different pieces of software by different individuals. I agree that having multiple people write code on top of each other isn't good, but collaboration would probably lead to more elegant solutions.

5.  
Software that is released rapidly contains fewer bugs, and the bugs that are found are smaller and easier to fix.  
To be successful launching a web-based startup, you need to know the technical side.
Rich companies buy expensive solutions because there was more invested by the application company in acquiring them, but the software is likely worse.

1.  
Wealth is not the same as money. You can create wealth and grow the 'wealth pie.'
In large companies, your effort is measured by the average, so you aren't incentivized to work harder. 

2. 
A single skilled programmer can make hundreds of thousands of dollars of value in a day, while a mediocre programmer can make zero or negative value with the introduction of bugs.  

3. He defines startups as businesses tackling hard technical problems. Is there an instance of a 'startup' combatting a non-technical hard problem? 

4.  
Is a boss always a proxy for the customers? In a big business, bosses do control work, but it seems like they may be less in touch with actual customer needs.

5.  
To gain wealth, put yourself in a position that has both measurement and leverage.
Seek out the harder problems for competitive advantage.
Numbers of users are a proxy for software quality.

1.  
Variation in wealth is not a bad thing; it's a sign of innovation. 
Take away individual's ability to keep the wealth they generate and you will stifle innovation.

2.  
We are trapped into thinking wealth should be distributed evenly because of how it was made historically (stolen). Because we were also given money as children, it seems unfair that some should have more than others.

3.  
Is how much someone makes only determined by the market? Are there other factors that influence pay of CEOs, basketball players, etc.?

4.  
Should everything be determined by the free market?   What about underpayment for people performing tasks that benefit society as a whole, not individuals as members of the society (research, etc.)? 

5. 
How much someone is worth is dependent on how desirable they are, it's not about what's "fair".
The creation of wealth is the most efficient way to get it (easier than stealing).
Increased wealth is better for everyone, and actually diminishes the perceived gap between the rich and poor (besides $).  
The earner of wealth must be able to retain it to want to create it.

1.  
Baysian filtering for spam is more effective than content filtering.

2.  
Spam filtering can be personalized based on the content of the spam and non-spam messages they receive. This is done by computing a spam probability from keywords in each.

3.  
I don't have any questions - this seems like a straightforward and elegant solution.

4.  
Spam will stop if people stop responding to it, but some people are enticed by the content of spam. If these people still respond to spam (15 in 1m), how will spam stop?

5.  
Employing statistics can be very effective in filtering spam. 
Spam is a business with no marginal cost.

1.  
There is such a thing as good design, not subject to personal preference. 

2.  
"Good design is strange". If good design is simple and suggestive, I'm curious how it can also be strange. I think this is the author's personal interpretation of things he likes. 

3.  
Many of the design ideas he gives are high-level. Are there any axioms to good design that are more concrete (beyond simple and symmetrical)? 

4.  
This list seems to be stream-of-consciousness opinions about design. Is good design really timeless? Is good design always daring?

5.   
Good design is simple 
Redesign is required to get it right

1.  
A quick explanation of and set of opinions on programming languages, open source, and programming culture.

2.  
High-level programming languages let us do powerful things with less specific code. The greater the level of abstraction, the easier it is.

3.  
What's the best method for choosing a programming language?

4.  
He said that object-orientation should be an option, not a requirement, of a language. What does this do to transferability and maintenance of code?

5.  
With high level language, you can transfer it from one machine to another with different compilers.

1.  
A discussion about languages, how their evolution influences their design, and what to be mindful of when designing a language

2.  
Programmers of the future will want to have languages that allow them to do quick prototyping with little effort. They'll want languages that are easier to write, but   can adapt their speed.

3.  
Do we need to bet on the branch that will be working in the next 100 years? Why not use what's applicable now?

4.  
Is it always best to stay on the main branches? Where do cutting-edge languages lie, and how can we figure out how they're going to do without exploring?

5. 
Know the evolution of languages to make good choices about what to use and how to create new languages
Languages that thrive have the smallest, cleanest cores
OO languages are not reusable because they're OO, it's because they're bottom-up (libraries for example)

1.  
Lisp is powerful language and knowing it gives you the freedom to evaluate other languages

2. 
I've never heard of Lisp in use, and he says Lisp is the most powerful language available. Is this still true?  

3.  
The author says a startup should give its competitors as little information as possible, but this seems contradictory to the open source mentality. Many leading startups (37 Signals included) gives quite a bit of information publically in their blog, etc. - what's best?

4.  
 Why not write in a language you're most proficient in, recognizing there might be easier ways to do it in languages you're not as good at?

5.   
Average performance by a startup means the startup will go out of business
Know the most powerful languages before deciding on what to use for specific applications
Use rare but powerful languages for your competitive advantage
Use job descriptions as a way to evaluate competitors

1.  
Not all programming languages are created equal

2.  
Lisp started out as a theoretical exercise, but became a language. It's still relevant because it's based on math, not technology.

3.  
It seems like many of the benefits of Lisp exist in Ruby. Is there any benefit to using Lisp now?

4.   
I haven't heard anything about Lisp macros - I think I would have by now if they were so crucial (but maybe not). Is this idea still relevant?

5.  
Choosing a more powerful language decreases the team size you need
Don't let non-technical managers make technical decisions for you

1. 
Exploring what makes languages popular and desirable

2.  
A language has to be popular to be good. This is because languages evolve on the surface, though their core will always remain relatively unchanged.

3.  
Java is popular largely because of its backing from Sun. How does corporate influence play a role?

4.  
Is it still the case that the language has to be around for a couple of years before even experts adopt. It seems that folks on the cutting edge like using the breakthrough implementations (node, for example).

5.  
Expert hackers are a tiny minority, but their decisions will influence all programmers
Hackers like succinctness. Succinctness comes from abstraction.
A good language should be clean (small core of well understood operators) and dirty (the programmers can do what they want with it)
Maintain healthy naivety (optimistic about solving the problem) and skepticism (what's the value of this solution?)

1.  
This chapter explores the intersection research and design  

2.  
Once you focus on the design of a language as a design problem, you will think of the user first. It's best to study what the user needs first.

3.  
How much of programming languages' popularity is luck, not just good design?

4.  
Ruby as designed for programmer happiness - but it also seems like it was originally developed (and in some ways, still is) in a vacuum. How much of the user research is necessary when you're designing a language that will eventually evolve?

5.  
  Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. 
If you're designing something for idiots, chances it won't be good, even for idiots.
To get good design you have to get close and stay close to your users.
Get a prototype in front of users as quickly as possible.
If you're bored when you draw something, the drawing will be boring.
