# Chapter 14 - The Dream Language

## Summary
  
* Graham lists what the characteristics of a dream language are: simple, not
  verbose, libraries, open source, good community, quick to prototype, and lots
  of abstractions that make sense to hackers. It has a built in profiler and
  perhaps tells you when your algorithms are not optimized. If the language
  lets you write inline code to optimize, even better.
* Greater levels of abstraction mean fewer tokens and less typing. Hackers are lazy.
* The Dream Language is not only open source, but open design

## What Stood Out

* "A programming language does need a good implementation of course, and this must be free. Companies will pay but hackers will not, and this is who you need to attract.

## Questions Unanswered

* Is Lisp still considered a dream language? Is it something we should be learning today.
* Is it possible to create this dream language?
* In a language, isn't there a barrier to understanding where things have been made easier for the programmer?

## Objections

* Organic growth is better, but yet we focus on who gets VC funding, etc.
* 

## Takeaways

* Be optimistic about your ability to solve the problem and pessimistic about your current solution.
* Choose a language that fits your specific needs and wants.
* Ensure that the documentation is strong and their is a thriving community for it.
