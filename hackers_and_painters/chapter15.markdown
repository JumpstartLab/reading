# Chapter 15 - Design and Research

## Summary
  
* In order to design anything well, the first priority needs to be your user
* The model of design should be creating a functional product as soon as possible, then stay close to your users through iteration.
* This model will allow you to maintain high morale and also build a product that your users actually want
* Even better, if you, yourself, are a user, you will likely build a better product
* The customer is always right, if only in the sense that good design will work for the user and solve a need

## What Stood Out

* Maintaining high morale throughout design is critical, as your interest in the product will largely determine its quality
* Give users what they need, not necessarily what they want. The customer IS always right, just not in the traditional sense.
* To decide what your users need, you must study them carefully and determine their problems, as a doctor diagnoses his patients

## Questions Unanswered

* Are there any situations in which it does make sense to move more towards the Hail Mary approach to design?
* How do you maintain morale while, at the same time, working in a demanding startup environment?
* Particularly in designing languages, how much of their popularity is a result of their design? Can a poorly-designed language be popular? A well-designed language can certainly fail to gain popularity.

## Objections

* It is not always the best idea to be a user of your own product. Earlier in the book, he advised against this because in developing for yourself, you might not be developing what is best for your users.
* Hail Mary cases have sometimes worked (despite what Paul says), and in some cases it may be better to stay stealth for a while.

## Takeaways

* Don't design for the lowest common denominator. Design for your users.
* Release your product early. Your users will tell you what you have to change.
* Design, like a painting, is never finished. You just stop working on it.
