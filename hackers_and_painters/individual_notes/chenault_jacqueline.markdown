# Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular

## Summary
  
* Summarizes why junior high & high school suck. Kids in High School are tortured/it is a 'bad' society for smart people.

## What Stood Out

* The concept that suburbs are for breeding surprised me a bit. Not that it is entirely out of left field - it makes sense - but I haven't heard it put quite that baldly before.
* Maybe it is because I was in a small private school in the middle of a city, but I didn't feel nearly as much pain growing up as the author did. It wasn't easy, certainly - but nor was it brutal. Though I freely admit that there are parts I don't really remember and it's quite possible that I block some of it out.
* I do agree with his concept about how 'normal' kids aren't necessarily any smarter or less intelligent than their 'smart' classmates - but instead the effort that 'smart' kids put into their education is simply put elsewhere. It is very interesting to be someone who was a 'smart' kid - at least to an extent - who has now learned how to put a little bit of time into appearance, etc - so much that people sometimes doubt my 'nerd cred' until I start talking HTML/CSS/Battlestar.

## Questions Unanswered

* I'd have to check the publish date, but I don't think the author has a sense of the genrational shift that happened right about when I was in Middle/High school. While the traditional 'popular' crowds are still around - it is no longer weird for people to play games all day. It's no longer considered quite so odd when people spend all their free time on computers, instead of watching TV or movies or hanging out with friends. There's something important that happens when children have computers on their desks and in their lives at a very young age. The things that the previous generation viewed as strange or nerdy or 'smart' are things the current generation considers everyday occurances. It's a fundamental shift, and changes the picture substatially in the next five years or so.

## Objections

* The author clearly has a lot of angst about being a high school/middle school student. And I imagine his HS/JHS experience was horrific. But I believe he's generalizing from his experience and from what is show in TV and movies.
* The author doesn't seem to think that there is popularity or social forces at work in the 'smart adult' community. That's so very wrong. It's there.
* There are skills that have to do with dealing with people in a society - even a flawed one - that you can only learn by interacting with that society. Yes, it may feel false and wrong, for all the reasons that he mentions - but even smart people have things they need to learn from such situations. School won't be the last time they encounter those scenarios, but school is a relatively safe place to figure out how to handle them.

## Takeaways

* The education system is broken.
* The life of a 'smart person' is likely as low as it will ever be in middle/high school.
* Smart kids aren't popular because they spend their time focusing on other things.
* (stolen from the sample, but it resonates) Have a purpose. It tends to make things better.

# Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

## Summary

* Hacking is like painting. When practiced well, they are both about creating something beautiful.
* Both hacking and painting/design require time and thought
* Hacking is not about science. It is about making. Hackers should not look to or aspire to be scientists (especially mathemeticians), they should take their cue from the makers - the painters, the authors, the carvers and the actors.

## What Stood Out

* I love the comparison of hacking to art. Perhaps because I spend much of my time thinking of myself as an artist and a creative. I think I would substitute 'maker' for 'creative'.
* Near the end he makes an interesting point - that the great painters were well-respected in their time - but not nearly so well-respected as they are now. And the great ones tended to emerge at the very early stages of their craft - the great Renaissance painters, or novel writers, and of course Shakespeare.
* Teamwork - in a painting (for example) the great master might take the main body of the image and their apprentices work on the background. It's interesting how he applies this to hacking/programming.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

* I think he's missing two crucial elements to the process of creatives, at least in the space I am most familiar with (theatre). The effect of collaboration and the necessity of trust. He touched on collaboration briefly - but implied that in great art, every contributor is given their little defined area to work on and together they create a masterwork. But the best parts of the creative process arise in the spaces between and around each contributor's balliwick. As an actor, I might be standing on stage, tears in my eyes, real emotion filling and pouring out just as the director and author desire - but the magic comes when my fellow actor pats my shoulder and I have to decide if I stay strong and play against the emotion or break down sobbing into their arms. The magic comes from the interplay between actors or creatives.

That sort of work - and it happens in theatre, in art, in design - in all situations where 'makers' or 'creatives' have a place - also requires a huge amount of trust. Creation is a terrifying, brave thing to do. Doing it with someone else - handing them your work and saying 'now do what you think should be done' - is not easy. But it MUST be done, because that is where the magic lives. And hacking is, I think (or perhaps hope) slowly beginning to realize that it needs both collaboration and trust.

## Takeaways

* I find myself thinking of a quote attributed to Ira Glass, even if it doesn't quite apply 100%
> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you wil finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions... It's gonna take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just gotta fight your way through.

# Chapter 3 - What can't we say? 

## Summary
* You should look for the things that are not to be said - the things that Society, for one reason or another, has declared verboten or untrue. Identify them, recognize them - but don't necessarily say them out loud.
* Keep absolute freedom to think - in your own head.

## What Stood Out

* To fight against things that you think should be said but are not permitted is not worth doing unless you truly care about the topic in question. It will eat up your life if you let it.
* Filters are placed upon us for various reasons. Stretch them - at least inside your own mind. That leaves you flexible enough to use and push at those filters when the time comes.

## Questions Unanswered

* I can see where this applies to hacking/programming - but I'm making the leap, the author doesn't seem to be, at least not yet.

## Objections

The premise seems reasonable. But I find myself curious just what his point is. I assume it loops back to hacking - to subtly imply that we should always be questioning how things are done and the status quo. That we should be aware when filters placed on us kick in.

## Takeaways

* Question the things that are not allowed. Challenge convention.
* Mind what is considered permissable today. You can push the boundaries - but it is hard to do. So choose your battles and fight on the ground that matters most.

# Chapter 4 - Good bad attitude

## Summary

* This is a follow-up to the last chapter - applying the concept of 'defying convention and what is allowed' to hackers.
* Hackers are sm

## What Stood Out

* Hackers are smart-alecks.
* The 'hacker' mentality has grown unpopular in recent generations, but it stretches back for a long, long time.
* The Founding Fathers were hackers, their subsequent heirs less-so.
* America - the innovative America - is not a world where people color in the lines.
* Image of Florence of the 1500's (? on year) - it was what New York is today.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

He's generalizing good programmers - implying that only those who constantly color outside the lines will succeed. I can understand the point. But I infer from his argument a call to be contrary and diffucult becuase 'that's how programmers are', and I just can't quite bring myself to agree. There is something sexy and interesting in the hacker mystique, the rebel programmer who doesn't do anything the way they're supposed to. But I don't think he's quite got his finger on the energy.

It's not about being contrary or different. It's about being inspired to do something or make something - and not letting anything get in the way of what you're inspired to do. It's a creative thing - not a defiant thing. The defiance or smart-alec-ness is secondary. You don't HAVE to be a smartass to be a good programmer.

## Takeaways

* Hackers have a (good) bad attitude (sometimes). Generally they are the good ones.
* Hackers don't follow convention. IE: Steve and Woz building computers very different from the ones the big companies made.


# Chapter 5 - The other road ahead

## Summary

* Cloud computing is the future.

## What Stood Out

* Server-based applications allow for easy deployment and updates.
* The assumption seems to be that all computers will always have network access

## Questions Unanswered

* If I run a business whose core functionality is contained in a web app - what happens if my internet goes out for the day? My data is stored on a server somewhere - I can't access it and get things done offline...

* Who owns the data stored on web app's servers? The customer? The company? Moving EVERYTHING to the web app world causes some risks there.

## Objections

* My objections to this chapter are my general objections to the web-app movement. I don't reject it completely - far from that. For some things (like Mint), a web app is the perfect move to make. 

However, that doesn't answer the question of what happens when you are not in a city or place that has access? I can throw any applications and data I want onto my lapotop, step onto a plane, and have full access to everything even if I'm not on a WIFI - capable plane. If everything I do runs out of a web app, then I'd be SOL.

## Takeaways

* Web apps are the future. Be ready. (Technically they are here now...)


# Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

## Summary

* Wealth is having the things you want and need - not necessarily money.
* Startups are earning all the lifetime wealth (and experiencing the lifetime stress) in a few years instead of over an entire career.
* Created wealth does not detract from the wealth of other people.

## What Stood Out

* Hackers are craftsmen who create wealth because their hands are writing the code.
* You as a hacker (or employee) create wealth for the company. Most companies are not set up to take advantage of this fact.
* Measure the value you bring, whenever possible.
* If you're in a job that feels safe, you're not going to get rich. (make strong moves?!?)
* Want to make money? Get past the early start-up phase, be profitable, and get customers. 

## Questions Unanswered

* Startups are a gamble. What about the ones that don't work - what's the loss in value because you spent 4 years stressed and overworked with 16 hour days and only recieved wrinkles and ulcers as your reward?

## Objections

## Takeaways


# Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap

## Summary

* There is a gap between those with wealth and those without, and that's not a bad thing,
* Those who have a lot of wealth got it because they are 'productive' while those without a lot of wealth are 'unproductive'
* The idle rich no longer exist. The rich work - because idleness is boring.

## What Stood Out

* The upper and lower class have disappeared from our society and been replaced by the top and bottom of the middle class.
* More expensive, luxury items used to do the job better than the mass-produced, cheap option. No more. (The only point to buying a custom-made car is to display that you can (!)). Brand, though, still matters.
* In societies where wealth is taxed heavily and re-distributed, things will only be done when they are fun - leaving un fun tasks untouched.

## Questions Unanswered

* The assumption is that wealth is directly proportionate to production. But what ensures that?
* What about the responsibility of people for the society in which they live? Heavier taxation on the rich means that the poor can be taxed a little less, and the money they are taxed goes to support society - things wanted by both the rich and the poor. Good schools to educate workers (adding value to each well-trained worker who will be able to produce more). Police to keep us safe from those who would steal wealth. Fire departments to keep our wealth from burning and hospitals to keep us from dying before we can enjoy our wealth. These are all things that taxes pay for.

## Objections

The author's experience with the rich seems limited to the tech-boom rich. Amid that crowd, one that earned their money, what he says is accurate. But that's not the whole story and it's not the complete picture of the rich.

That's not to say that the rich are all lazy. Not at all. But there are some rich who don't learn to work for what they have, and some who do.

He also seems to imply that so long as you are productive you will be paid relative to your productivity, and therefore those who have more wealth are simply more productive (and perhaps lucky) than those with less. But that assumes a fairness in compensation that does not necessarily exist. If it did exist, then women wouldn't earn approximately 77% what men earn. source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male%E2%80%93female_income_disparity_in_the_United_States)

Also, taxes. See above in unanswered questions.

## Takeaways

* The rich are not evil. They're just more productive.
* An income gap is proof that there are people in society being productive. It is not a sign of a poor economy.


# Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

## Summary

* It's possible to stop spam (!)
* Use statistic-based models and filters rather than looking for specific triggers in content.

## What Stood Out

* False positives become more dangerous as spam filters are more restrictive/the more spam one recieves.
* Whitelists are good for decreasing computation, certainly.

## Questions Unanswered

* What is the current model of spam detection? What makes it bad? It's inferred but never actually explained.

## Objections

* He treats his work as a huge discovery. And it IS pretty interesting. But isn't it just an updated way of recognizing what is an isn't spam? How is this so vastly different from what we've always done - tried to recognize spam and filter it out? Doesn't this just represent the next evolution in spam detection? Which is cool - but not earth-shattering.

## Takeaways

* The next step in spam filtering is statistic-based models that can be modified based on the user's classification of emails as spam or not spam.



# Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers

## Summary

* A basic overview of 'good design'.

## What Stood Out

* Good design is simple! When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
* Good design means a building or object should let you use it as you want - not in the way the architect or product designer programmed it to be used.
* Good design is redesign (AKA iteration?)
* Cultivate dissatisfaction.
* Don't worry about creating a style. If you try to create good things, your own style will emerge. The only style worth having is the one you can't help.
* Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems

## Questions Unanswered

* He addressed symmetry - but not the Golden Mean or rule of 1/3. Touched on it briefly in referencing 'nature' but still. Things that are pleasing to the eye and are NOT symmetical tend to use the golden mean.

## Objections

* None as read. These ideas are repeated many times over in the design community.

## Takeaways

* Good design is simple. Simplicity is hard. But it is also worthwhile.


# Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained

## Summary

* The chapter is a basic rundown of programming languages and their types, the open source movement, and the culture of programmers.

## What Stood Out

* Language levels: Machine language, assembly language, high-level language.
* High-level languages are less specific than the machine language they're translated to.
* What ships to the user is essentially the machine language.
* Languages are not all the same - but many of those who insist one is better than the other say so because they are just used to their 'home' language.

## Questions Unanswered

* How does one choose which language to use, or which qualities are best to use in a language? (and yes, the answer would be to decide what you need to do with the program and pick a language - but I know that because I know it, not because he's clearly saying it out loud)

## Objections

## Takeaways

* There are a lot of languages - and they are tools. Flexibility matters.
* Hackers these days work in high-level languages.



# Chapter 11 - The Hundred-year language.

## Summary

* What language will hackers be working in in 100 years? Will it be something today's hackers could recognize and use?
* Identifies the things that have changed and remained constant in languages.

## What Stood Out

* Languages evolve. Languages that don't evolve will eventually die. IE: Cobol, Java(?)
* The most comfortable language to use is probably a pretty main branch on the tree.
* Good waste is the places where, by spending more, we can get simpler designs.
* Write to try and figure something out, not necessarily knowing where you are going.
* Wasting programmer time is inefficient & gross. Wasting machine time is not.
* Language design by hackers/open source, like Perl, Python, and Ruby.
* The need for efficiency has generally gone down over time, allowing more small languages the freedom to roam.

## Questions Unanswered

## Objections

## Takeaways

100 years from now programs will still look like programs to our eyes, even if we don't know the language they're written in and the concepts involved have evolved past our easy understanding. So why not write the 100 year language now?


# Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages

## Summary

* Choosing the right language - in the author's case, Lisp - allows you the flexibility you need when creating software.

## What Stood Out

* Programming languages are tools. Everyone (or at least, every computer) speaks them. So why treat one as a dead languages that you'd only use to learn to be a better programmer?
* Choosing the right language, one that was flexible & allowed for fast development, allowed the author's startup to grow in a way necessary for startups to survive.
* Read competitor's job descriptions as a method of evaluating them.

## Questions Unanswered

* At what point does a language go from 'rare' to 'regular'? There are some who'd call Ruby rare - but at the same time, every third job opening seems to want someone with Ruby/Rails experience. So is it now a 'regular' language, or is that position still fast held with C, C++. and Java?

## Objections

* Just because a computer understands a language doesn't mean it's a living language. People - the people you work with when solving the problem - have to speak the langugage too, and to be able to understand how you speak it.

* A lot of this chapter seems to infer that you should seek to use a weird language just for the sake of using a weird language. I'd say you should use the language that best suits the task you are putting before it. You can't control what your competitors understand or do not understand. You can only control your own company and their actions.

## Takeaways

* 'Rare' languages can help you as a startup - which is where you earn money. Uniqueness is good. Flexibility is key. The power of a language is multiplied by the number of competitors who don't get it.
