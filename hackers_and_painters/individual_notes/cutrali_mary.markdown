#Chapter 1#

###Summary###

* secondary school is broken and has come to resemble prisons rather than institutions for learning.
* students can't be smart and also popular. they must choose one or the other.
* there is a black and white divide between nerds and socialized students.
* Nerds have advanced themselves because they refuse to play into the "game" that secondary school sets up

###What Stood Out?###
* I was most surprised by not an idea, but the authors tone. I was unable to relate to the author's experience in school. Popularity wasn't an issue in my secondary school experience nor when I was much younger. It seemed to me that in the schools that I went to, the smarter and more capable you were, the more popular you also were. 


###Questions Unanswered###

* There was no effort to pose a probable solution to the "popularity" issue (just a reiteration that the secondary education system in the US is a broken system. The message in the chapter would have been more effective if the author had chosen to present a way to fix the problem rather than just an airing of grievances. 

###Objections###

* While reading I found myself disagreeing with the author's choice to create black and white experiences for smarts & populars (as I've taken to calling them). I don't think it's an effective structure for describing socialized society or for describing a high school experience.  

###Take Aways###

* There is an inherent problem in the way MOST Americans approach the idea of schooling. 
* Children are greatly effected by their treatment at school. 
* A great deal of children view being smart as a curse rather than a blessing because of the social consequences that smartness may bring. 

# Chapter 2 - Hackers & Painters

### Summary
  
* The disciplines of art and hacking have some innate similarities. 
* Both artists and hackers must find creative ways to solve problems 
* Aesthetics are important 
* Beauty is a perceived quality that is malleable to discipline 

### What Stood Out

* The entire argument this chapter makes stood out to me. I had never stood to think that art and electronic disciplines were similar in any way. The chapter made an effort to turn preconceived notions that one may have on their heads. 

### Questions Unanswered

* No questions for this chapter. The author sets up a pretty straightforward argument. 

### Objections

* I like figuring things out on paper beforehand and think it's effective for finding errors. 
* The themes of schools & educational institutions being ineffective are carried over in this chapter as well. The argument takes away from overarching and important points the author is trying to make. 

### Takeaways

* Whether it is apparent or not, the act of writing code is a dynamic and creative experience, and most people do not treat hackers are creators, but rather as mathematic problem solvers.

# Chapter 3 - What You Can't Say

### Summary
  
* Morals (whether we are conscious of them or not) dictate the way we approach any and all situations. 
* Everyone carries a set of prescribed actions based upon cultural/social norms. 
* It is difficult to break free from norms and to create interesting and dynamic experiences/code/questions/etc. 

## What Stood Out

* Conformity is a problem even in subversive or subcultural scenarios (this is implied rather than explicitly stated in the text) 
* Specific words carry greater weight when we are describing someone making statements that are in contrast to preconceived norms. 

### Questions Unanswered

* Which notions do we hold today that the author views as harmful and that are created as a result of norms. 
* Is going against the norm productive in a normalized and binary society such as the one the author sets up in the first chapter. 

### Objections

* While norms shape the way we experience culture, I believe that those "smarts" we are introduced to in the first chapter have enough gusto and intuition to parse out those norms they feel are correct and incorrect to form a set of new norms associated with the society they are currently involved in. 

### Takeaways

* One should always question the norms and the outcomes of experiences (morals, preconceptions, etc) to a certain extent. 
* All societies are normalized and full of unspoken faux pas. 
* Norms are not static and changes as society changes. 
* curiosity allows us to explore language. 
* Subversiveness/Disregard for the norm may lead to productive creativity 

# Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude

### Summary
  
* Hackers are good programmers because they are subversive 
* America is the ONLY place that a sort of rich technological culture can exist because of its unique culture. 
* liberty (civil, cultural, personal) allows for creativity and excessive rule-making stifles creativity. 

### What Stood Out

* The description of hackers as unruly, disobedient misfits is particularly interesting but also troubling 
* Author describes himself as a "smart-aleck" (I don't necessarily object). 
* 
### Questions Unanswered

* What is the difference between a 'bad' idea and a good idea. what is the criteria on which we judge ideas. (I'm of the argument that all ideas are good [in theory] and that there must be a sort of progression of ideas for a good idea to emerge). 

### Objections

* slight discomfort with the idea of "disobedience" as presented by the author (as a result of intellect). 

### Takeaways

* Computer technology most often developed by "outsiders" 
* Language is complex & words can mean more or less than we intend them to. 
* America is a place for great technical growth as a result of its subversive nature. 

# Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead

### Summary
  
* a (very) brief history of view and how it pioneered ASPs. 
* web-based software is universal and allows users to be hands off (in terms of updates) 
* debug early and often
* plans sometimes fall through, write adaptable programs 

### What Stood Out

* users value convenience (and so should developers) 
* compound bugs are a result of lazy developing. 
* the idea of subscription fees was particularly interesting and relevant. 

### Questions Unanswered

* more info about "functional programming"? 

### Objections

* I understand that the author's primary experience is with ViaWeb, but would have liked to see examples from other company's. 
* The section on support was somewhat underdeveloped and didn't do much to serve the purpose of this section. 
* this particular essay was a bit wordy and got lost in itself and in repetition. 

### Takeaways

* data is safer in web-based applications 
* convenience and simplicity is key 
* good design is important so users can interact more effectively.
* web based software requires fewer programmers 
* users guide design & optimization 


# Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

### Summary
  
* start-ups take on hard technical problems 
* hackers produce work in "excess" of what they are paid (author estimates 36x) 
* how to make money by creating wealth 

### What Stood Out

* success has an inherent randomness. 
* money is fixed, wealth is not 
* wealth is made but not distributed 

### Questions Unanswered

* None for this chapter. The author is much more straight-forward here than other chapters. 

### Objections

* I think this definition of "wealth" may be too broad. 
* the political overtones in this chapter overshadow the author's own voice. 

### Takeaways

* Wealth creation comes out of the hard work and dedication of driven individuals 
* there is some luck to wealth creation. 
* CEOs are responsible for the success of their companies. 
* People at start-uos want to work a lot harder. 
* successful user acquisition is necessary for financial success and wealth creation. users drive the business 

# Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap

### Summary
  
* wealth must be generated. 
* some people are more productive than others & are therefore compensated in accordance with that multiplier. 
* disparities in wealth can occur for a variety of reasons. 
* technology isn't a "wealth" disparity but one of productivity. 

### What Stood Out

* the market determines worth of work done. 
* concentration of skill (not skill itself) is the determinant of productivity and wealth creation 
* there is a suspicion surrounding the rich 

### Questions Unanswered

* no questions in this chapter, the author covers points thoroughly. 

### Objections

* there are times when the author uses richness and wealth synonymously but then swears they are not the same. this contradiction is troubling and detracts from themes in the essay. 

### Takeaways

*  Making money is a "skill" 
* technology increases our capacity for productivity, but does not necessarily bridge the gap in income (although it may distribute wealth). 
* variation in income is a sign of health 


# Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

### Summary
  
* Spam can be stopped with content based filters 
* Statistical Filtering is an effective method 
* many different kinds of software should be used simultaneously 

### What Stood Out

* The author stands behind Bayesian filters and considers them to be the only effective way to filter spam. 

### Questions Unanswered

* This argument seems out of place in the flow of the essay. It's disjointed and confusing to place it here. 

### Objections

* Same as above bullet, i'm confused about the context of this chapter. 

### Takeaways

* look at overall qualities rather than individual markers 

# Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers 
### Summary
  
* Good design is simple & timeless & solves the right problem 
* taste is not subjective 
* aesthetics are mostly taught but taste is innate. 

### What Stood Out

* problems as well as solutions can be improved.  
* "good" design is suggestive 

### Questions Unanswered

* even though this chapter preaches against the subjective nature of taste, the author seems to dictate that his notion of taste is best, and that doesn't seem to jive with other themes in the chapter? 

### Objections

* taste IS subjective (who is the determinant of taste?) -- however, i think the author's argument against the subjective nature of taste ties into his argument about social constructs and norms. 
* The author's examples (Dürer especially) in relation to funniness do not necessarily make sense. 

### Takeaways

* Everyone wants to do things *better* than the next person 
* humor and strength have a strong relation 
* symmetry is a timeless principle (recursion, spatial, formal)
* there is no shortcut to strangeness 

# Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained

### Summary
  
* While machine language is useful it is neither well-designed nor beautiful (in a conventional sense) 
* Compilers & interpreters assist programmers 
* Open source gives users control of functionality and design. 
* Language choice should depend on the project at hand.

### What Stood Out

* Debugging in Open Source is much less complicated because EVERYONE has access to fix things. 
* Open Source and intellectual property go hand in hand. 

### Questions Unanswered

* Does anyone still write in assembly language and for what purpose? 

### Objections

* None in this chapter. 

### Takeaways

* conventions of language are the same in programming and people languages. 
* static and dynamic typing is an unavoidable binary in the programming world. 
* OO work is not a binary and is a more complicated debate based on notions of degrees of object-orientedness 

# Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language

### Summary
  
*  languages evolve over time through a series of organic and inorganic transformations

### What Stood Out

* languages evolve slowly because they are not technologies

### Questions Unanswered

* no questions for this chapter. the author is fairly straight forward and repeats himself quite a bit. 

### Objections

* Again, objecting to the authors tone towards anything that isn't Lisp. 

### Takeaways

* clear fundamental operators are most important for long term survival. 
* flexibility is valued. 

# Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages 

### Summary
  
* In technology, ignore the masses -- choose what suits you best (this seems to be an overarching theme in the book) 
* all languages are not created equal and continue to evolve 

### What Stood Out

* Lisp is an "enlightened" language
* high-level language are degrees separate from each other. 
* There is more commentary from the author about the "underground" and his endorsement of such. 

### Questions Unanswered

* no questions in regards to this chapter. 

### Objections

* The comparisons to artists are really loose at best in this chapter.  
* This chapter reads as an advertisement for Lisp and that really takes away from its main points about the freedom of choice in language. 

### Takeaways

* start-ups do things better and faster because they are allowed to make choices. 
* success is based upon the ability to do things better and faster than competition 

# Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds 

### Summary
  
* The author drives home the point to the readers that there is no such thing as the perfect language but that there is a perfect language for each project. 
* Mathematics (with proof) are never wrong and produce timeless results 

### What Stood Out

* The same binary of nerds vs. non-nerds is repeated in this chapter.

### Questions Unanswered

* Why Lisp? For what reasons beyond personal preference and "timelessness" 

### Objections

* My objection to this chapter is the same as in others. I think the authors assumptions of a binary are 

### Takeaways

* decidedly non-techy people often times make the rules for technology and stalwart development
* using a powerful language creates less cluttered and better programs & tools
* patterns are a sign of "trouble" 

# Chapter 14 - The Dream Language

### Summary
  
* Opinion of hackers will determine popularity of programming languages 
* the design of language is such that it must either replace a current scripting language or that it must be MORE than a language. 
* Subversiveness is inherent to hackers. 
* the "dream language" is clear and terse and allows for powerful libraries from within a small core. it is truthful and straightforward and allows its users to influence design. 

### What Stood Out

* A language must be popular to be "good" but not "good" to be popular. 
* Allow second-guessing in your language but do not allow for double-entendres. 

### Questions Unanswered

* no questions here. the chapter was clear. 

### Objections

* This chapter (as well as others) takes a tone against Perl that is almost offensive to the reader whether or not one is a user of Perl. 

### Takeaways

* Hackers have a different expectation than language designers concerning language itself 
* fast code does not come from the language directly but rather the hackers ability to subvert the language. 
* re-designs are just as important as the originating structure. 

# Chapter 15 - Design & Research 

### Summary
  
* Design is user-focused. 

### What Stood Out

* design isn't an LCM, must design for a "specific" user or user-group. 
* >> Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually re- fining it, you try to create the complete, finished product in one long touchdown pass. Countless startups destroyed themselves this way during the Internet Bubble. I’ve never heard of a case where it worked.

### Questions Unanswered

* No questions here. 

### Objections

* Similar to my objections regarding Perl, I'm almost offended in the way the author addresses mathematics as though it's some sort of lesser discipline. 

### Takeaways

* languages are natural to development NOT a vehicle for programming 
* in order to develop a good design, can't stray too far from the users.
