Chapter 1

1) 

*	Nerds are unpopular because they are too busy being smart to do what it takes to be popular

*	Suburban schools are essentially holding pens for teenagers. They foster boredom, cruelty, and rebellion.

2) I thought that the idea that teenagers are driven crazy by the idleness of their lives, and that people need something to work on to be sane and happy, was an interesting one.

3) Graham spends a chapter describing the faults of the US school system but does not propose any concrete solutions.

4) The chapter reads like a justification for Graham's unpopularity in middle and high school. I am not convinced by his arguments.

5) 

*	People need something to work on to keep from going crazy.

*	High school sucked for everyone.


Chapter 2

1) 

*	Hackers are more like painters than scientists because they are makers. Hackers and painters sketch their ideas, learn by doing, and are devoted to beauty.

*	Universities want hackers to be scientists, corporations want them to be engineers. They are neither.

*	Programs that people get paid well to write are boring. The best hackers work on open source projects because they love hacking, and you can't be great at something unless you love doing it.

2) That a programming language should be used to help you think of a program, not to write out programs you've already thought of. A programming language is an artistic medium and a program is the expression.

3/4) Graham ignores the ways in which hacking is similar to the sciences. He makes a convincing argument that hacking is, or at least can be, a creative endeavor, but hardly touches on the similarities -- mainly logical reasoning and critical thinking. These aspects don't really factor into the creative arts, or at least not in the same way.

5)

*	Empathy is very important to be a good hacker.

*	Hacking is an art form.


Chapter 3

1) 

*	In every era there are certain things that people can't say. These things are considered offensive and wrong, but are controversial because they could be true.

*	Smart people are more willing to consider shocking ideas. This doesn't necessarily mean that they should share them directly with everyone.

2) I hadn't ever considered the possibility that I was self-censoring because my thoughts are controversial, but once I thought about it I realized it was true. I also realized that my closest friends are the ones who might share those thoughts or at least hear me out if I expressed them.

3) In an ideal world, would we all be saying exactly what we think? Isn't it better that we don't, and that we have moral fashions to keep us in check?

4) I'm beginning to feel like each chapter in this book is an explanation/justification for another of Graham's personality quirks. This chapter is why it's ok that he's an asshole.

5) 

*	Conventional wisdom isn't always right, and it's important to be critical of convention.


Chapter 4

1) 

*	The word "hack" has two meanings that seem at odds with each other -- one is an ugly solution, the other an exceptionally elegant one. What they have in common is that they break the rules.

*	A good hacker has a tendency to break rules. America has historically been a place where certain types of rule breaking are tolerated. More recent intellectual property laws and other laws restricting civil liberties could interfere with the ability of hackers to come up with great new ideas.

2) The best hacking has an element of wrongness. When you start something, you don't know if it's going to be really great or really wrong; the two are closely related.

3/4) Why does Graham think we are heading towards totalitarianism? I think we are in a period of adjustment to new technologies, and eventually will hit the right balance of freedom and regulation. If anything the hackers have the advantage in this new world, as evidenced by the effective shutdown of SOPA/PIPA. I'm aware that the book was written in 2004, but it seems to me now that in 2012 that what hackers do is increasingly important, so regualtions may be eased to support them.

5) 

*	Hacking and breaking rules are intrinsically intertwined. Governments need to give hackers freedom to learn and create.


Chapter 5

1)

*	Web-based software is superior to desktop software in almost every way. It is easier for users, it can be written in any programming language, it can be fixed and updated dynamically -- no new releases or updates, it has fewer bugs, it is cheaper, it is accessible anywhere.

2) I thought it was pretty amazing that Graham essentially predicted the future. Nearly everything is server-based now, or moving towards it.

3) What about operating systems? That is just about the only thing still released with a big announcement and a version number - iOS, OS X, Windows. Are we moving away from that?

4) I thought it was interesting that Graham's ciritcal prediction for Microsoft ended up being more applicable to what Apple is doing successfully now with their app stores for iOS and OS X, re server/desktop hybrid. Perhaps the server/desktop hybrid is the future of personal computing.

5) 

*	Web/server > desktop


Chapter 6

1)

*	Wealth and money are not the same thing. Wealth is something that people want. Wealth can be created. Good software costs nothing to create but has value.

*	To create wealth you must have measurement and leverage. Measurement means that your compensation is reflected in how hard you work, and leverage means that you have control over the success or failure of your endeavor. As a developer in a large company you have neither of these things, and as an employee at a small startup you have both.

*	Working on harder problems is more valuable.

2) It is interesting to look at working at a startup in the view that you are essentially squeezing a lifetime of money making into a few years, by fitting a whole career's worth of effort and stress into a job that you only have for a short time.

3/4) The discussion on the failure of a startup was short, and everything that Graham says about making money from a startup is irrelevant if the startup fails. I think that a discussion on money to be made from a startup can't brush over the fact that most startups fail and no money is made at all.

5)

*	Startups generate wealth because the people who work for them will make more money for working harder and every individual has an effect on the success of the company.


Chapter 7

1)

*	There is income inequality because there are different amounts of demand for different jobs.

*	In older times the most common way of obtaining wealth was by stealing it. Once creating wealth became the easiest and most common form of obtaining wealth, societies became richer as a whole.

*	Technology may have increased the monetary gap between rich and poor, but it has decreased the gap in quality of life.

*	Variation in income is a sign of health in an economy.

2) Overpaid and underpaid don't really mean anything in a free market. People get paid what the market will bear.

3) What about acquisition of marketable skills and inequality in education? Not addressed even though they influence the wealth of individuals and is the reason that so many people are poor.

4) Graham writes: "If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but worse off than I am now, I'd take the first option." I don't think this is true at all. Standard of living is subjective and based on how others around us live. If he were the poorest he would not be happy.

5)

*	I'm not a Libertarian.


Chapter 8

1)

*	Statistical approaches, and specifically Bayesian filters, are the best for blocking spam.

*	The better spam filters get, the less effective spam becomes.

2) Graham sees spam filters as a competition with spammers. He wants his filters to work so there is no competition.

3) Not a question that was necessarily relevant when Graham wrote this, but would it be possible to create an effective Bayesian filter for phishing scams?

4) --

5) 

*	Spam is bad and if we get really good at filtering it we can eradicate it.


Chapter 9

1)	

*	Taste is not subjective -- you get better at it over time.

*	Good design is simple, timeless, is hard to do though looks easy. It is often improving upon something that already exists.

2) Good design can copy. It's not necessarily being original that's important, but rather doing something better than anyone else has done it before. It requires knowing a lot about your subject. I think this is really important to remember in software development -- we're not necessarily trying to come up with something new and amazing; we want to find a better way to do things that are already being done.

3) Good design happens in chunks. It seems to be true, but why?

4) --

5)

*	Good design is deceptively simple. It is improving upon something that already exists.


Chapter 10

1)

*	High-level languages are the most convenient because they are easier to write than machine or assembly languages and they are portable across platforms as long as you have an interpreter or compiler.

*	Open source software is preferred because users have access to the source code, so bug fixes and changes can be made quickly and by anyone, whereas for commerical software you need to wait for the company to release a bux fix or new version.

*	Some people say that all programming languages are basically the same; this is not true. They are different but it is hard to tell which is best.

*	Languages should not have so many rules and restrictions. Dynamic typing is preferable to static.

*	Object orientation in a language should be an option but not a requirement.

2) It is a good thing that there are so many different languages. Having only one computer language would be probelmatic.

3) Understood that C is the preferred language for operating systems because it is low-level so can interact quickly, but what languages are best for other applications?

4) I don't really know enough about programming languages to disagree with anything Graham says, but I have a feeling that a few months from now I will be offended.

5) 

*	There is no best programming language. I should try to learn several to I can understand the merits of each.


Chapter 11

1)

*	Computer languages evolve slowly because they are notations rather than technologies. Computer languages of the future will be similar to today's. The first computer languages were invented about 50 years ago; today's languages would have been understood by and useful to programmers 50 years ago.

*	Languages should trade efficiency for convenience. Since computers are only getting faster, a program that is more convenient to write and understand is preferable even if it's less efficient.

*	Languages of the future will be open-source, and/or written by the people who actually want to use them.

2) It's interesting that Graham things there will be fewer programming languages in the future. If the aim is to optimize convenience, it might make more sense to have languages specific to specific tasks. Also, people will keep writing languages that they want to use, and older languages will continue to be used to maintain older systems. We are still using C now which is over 40 years old.

3) Graham says that Java is an "evolutionary dead end". What of Java itself?

4) --

5) 

*	We could already be writing the programming language of the future.


Chapter 12

1)

*	Viaweb's software was written in Lisp. Lisp is a high-level programming language that Graham believes to be the most powerful.

*	Viaweb had an edge over their competitors. First, since their software ran on their own server it could be written in any language, and they chose Lisp. Also, since Lisp is more powerful than other more conventional languages, they were able to write code quickly and add features that their competitors added in only a couple of days. They could do things with their software that their competitors could not with other languages.

2) It's interesting that the fact that Viaweb was using Lisp was purposefully kept secret. It shows how important choice of programming language is if the choice of one language over another is a competitive advantage.

3) What does it mean for a programming language to be powerful?

4) --

5)

*	Choice of programming language is important.

*	I want to understand what Lisp macros are.


Chapter 13

1)

*	The average boss at a corporation will want programmers to use a language like Java because it is a standard and it is popular, so programmers can easily be replaced. Programmers should really be using the most powerful language available.

*	The progression of "cool" programming languages is moving towards Lisp, which was invented in 1958. Lisp embodied several new ideas, most of which have been incorporated into newer languages.

*	To solve hard problems it is important to use powerful languages like Lisp. Programs can be several times shorter when written in Lisp as opposed to C, which means that they can be written more quickly and by fewer people.

2) Technology should be cutting-edge. If you are working in the technology industry and using outdated programming languages, why bother?

3) If Lisp has been around for so long and is so powerful, why hasn't it become popular?

4) --

5)

*	"Industry best practice" is not (necessarily) the best.


Chapter 14

1)

*	A programming language needs to be free and have good documentation.

*	It needs to be succinct, flexible, powerful, and efficient.

*	It needs to be good for writing throwaway programs because that is where most larger programs begin.

*	It needs to have good libraries that are easy to navigate.

*	It needs time to be adopted and improved, and it needs to be well-designed and redesigned.

2) I thought the section on big bang vs. organic growth was interesting and made a lot of sense. A programming language that becomes popular by word of mouth must be doing something that people are interested in and want to use, while the buzzy big launch one may just be a passing fad.

3) I am curious to read about the Arc programming language and see how closely he sticks to his own guidelines.

4) 

5) 

*	Some programming languages really are better than others.

*	I want to pay attention and be one of the early adopters for the next big thing.


Chapter 15

1)

*	To design well you need to have the users in mind. You will design better if you yourself are a user. You will not design well if you look down upon your users.

*	The test of a language should be how easy it is to work with it, not how good the finished product looks. Design needs to start as a sketch and have the details filled in.

*	To design well, you need to be interested in and like what you're doing.

2) I like the Jane Austen example. Your programs should not be self-indulgent. You should stay close with your users and test your ideas on them as quickly as possible.

3) How are Graham's ideas applicable when one is programming for a job at a company instead of for oneself? I'd imagine that it would be hard to pick your users and be completely interested and engaged in your subject if you are working for someone else who is telling you what to write.

4) 

5)

*	Good design means putting yourself in the position of the user and completely immersing yourself in the project. You need to really like what you're doing.
