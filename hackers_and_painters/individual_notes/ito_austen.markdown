# Chapter 1

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* The chapter is talking about how secondary school is broken. It explains how 
  school is like a prison intended to keep children busy while the adults are at work.
* Nerds are ahead of the game because they want to don't want to play the game 
  being played in secondary school. They want to work on real problems.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that secondary school is a prison intended to keep children busy. 
Since kids don't have real world problems to solve, they resort to popularity
contents. Not having real world things to do extends to college, CS programs
in particular. They are keeping kids busy without teaching them real-world
applications.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Paul Graham doesn't have any ideas on how to fix school. He just says that it's 
broken and good luck going through the current bureaucracy.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

None.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

I want to remember to question everything, even things that I have believed
to be true for a long time. Just because it feels natural, doesn't mean that
it's right.

# Chapter 2

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Disputing that hacking doesn't belong in the computer science field because
  the way we write software is different. Hacking is more like making, writing,
  painting, art.
* Hacking needs a medium that is malleable like painting. He argues for dynamic
  languages or a language that allows us to change as we go. He really is
  talking about agile web development.
* It's important to think about others when writing software because you aren't
  the only person that will be reading it.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that software doesn't belong in computer science. For a while I
believed that there was a disconnect between software and computer science,
that universities were doing it wrong. Professors would tell us to remember
that we are scientists! I have not once in my professional career done
something scientific. I'm a maker of software.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

He talks about how hacking is the new medium that everyone is exploring. I
wonder how often new mediums arise? Is software an outlier?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Graham likes debugging because it's "straightforward", however I don't feel the
same way. Debugging is often harder, at least in my experience, because it 
exposes a problem in your design. It may be harder to fix the bug because of a 
flaw in what you wrote. It tells you about a use-case that you never thought of.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Hacking is in it's infancy and we are being challenged to push what we can do
with computing to it's limits. It is a very exciting time to be a developer.

# Chapter 3

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about ideas coming from places such as moral fashions.
  People have been trained to not question fashionable ideas, however by 
  questioning these beliefs, people can learning intersting things. This is
  true in a business world where a market can emerge from a place where people
  believe something to be true, when in reality it is not true.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea whenever there is something that people believe to be true or is
fashionable, we need to be thinking about why this is and if it is indeed
a truth. We are all taught that we need to question everything however when
it comes to mob mentaility or what is a convention in the industry, we tend
to lose the "question everything" mentality. It is very important to keep
that thought alive.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What in human nature causes people to create these moral fashions?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

None

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

* The quote, "The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, 
  not to say what you want."

# Chapter 4

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Hacking is both a good and bad term describing a quick, dirty solution and an
  elegant solution.
* Graham argues that hackers don't like copywrite laws becuase they prevent
  good ideas from being formed because they are restricting what hackers do to
  learn.
* Government intervention and spying stops innovation, which is what America is
  built upon.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I never thought about GNP per capita vs. a country's civil liberties. It could
possibly be true.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

I wonder if America is on a downward trend to become a country like Florence.
Will America still have it's innovation glory in 100 years? Are other people
thinking about this?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

While I was suprised by his assumption that GNP per capita vs. a country's 
civil liberties would be directly related, I think that is too broad of an
assumption. I feel like there are a lot of reasons why countries do not have a
higher GNP and it is not just what a country's citizens are allowed to do.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

A key takeaway I want to remember is the following quote: 

The spirit of resistance to government," Jefferson wrote, "is so valuable on 
certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive."

A lot of what Graham is writing about is thinking outside of the lines and not
being restricted by boundaries set upon us by institutions, the media, and 
society.

# Chapter 5

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Talks about the success of viaweb and what it took to become a startup that
  was eventually bought about by Yahoo.
* Desktop software vs. Web applications and why the web is the future because
  it lets you move so much faster, contains all of the infrustrcture (clients)
  for you, and why big companies are afraid of it.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that the barrier to business is not that you don't know anything about
business or the competition. These things yoou can figure out as you go. Those
barriers are things that people make up that stop themselves from jumping off
the startup ledge.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Graham talks about what startup life is like and how to make money, however he
never talks about what it really means to be in a startup. I feel like he
explains a magical leap between jumping into startup life and being successful.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I have a disagreement between his argument of web vs. desktop development. He
argues that web development is so much faster and better than desktop apps,
however the reason is that desktop apps are so much more complicated, contain
more features, and do more than web apps can do and this moment. 

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

I want to remember that the reason why startups don't get started is because of
the fake walls that people put up instead of the real reasons that it's a lot
of work.

# Chapter 6

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**
 
 * This chapter explains what wealth is, which isn't money. According to
   Graham, wealth is something that people want. Everyone can create wealth
   especially hackers because they are creators. They create applications that
   people want.
 * This chapter also briefly talks about how to become rich by creating wealth
   and how startups choose what problems they tackle.
 * He also explains wealth in terms of leverage and measurement as a means to
   effectively creating wealth.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The idea that surprised me was that startups choose problems that are so hard
that they are 1) hard to reproduce 2) hard for larger companies to create. This
protects the "wealth" of a startup. I always wondered how VCs decided that an
idea is worth pursing, so it is interesting to get Graham's perspective on his
selection process.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

The unanswered question is how to become part of the 1%. I don't want to say
that it isn't possible, however I want to hear Graham's take on the people that
become part of the top 1% of developers.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I argue about his numbers and assumptions that he is making about the multipier
for startup's, however I understand his point. Everything is not an exact
science in startups and there is always a part left to chance.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Creating wealth is not about creating money, it's about creating products that
people value. Wealth is the creation of things that matter.

# Chapter 7

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about what the gap between the rich and the poor means.
  Graham argues that having a gap means that innovation is happening instead of
  people cheating, stealing or using some other ways of becoming rich. 
* If the gap between rich and poor doesn't exist, it means that people aren't
  creating wealth or are not creating anything that people want. This causes
  stagnation.
* If you want to become rich work on hard problems using technology

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

It was interesting that technology increases the gap in income however bridges
the gap between the way people live.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Everyone that isn't rich believes that they would do something completely
different (i.e not work) if they were millionares. However he says that even
rich people work. My question is if their drive to work is what got them rich
and how they really feel about work after becoming rich.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**
 
I question his argument about rich people creating all types of innovation.
What about rich people that aren't creating wealth. I feel like he is giving a
very broad generalization and is mainly talking about America.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

At least in America, rich people make our lives easier and better with the
wealth that they create.

# Chapter 8

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about a different approach to spam filters. Filtering
  messages based on context as opposed to matching words.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

It was surprising to me that spam companies actually make money. I felt like I
knew that they made money or they wouldn't send spam, however it is still
surprising that people click on their links.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

He notes that he has not updated this chapter so I wonder how people with great
spam filters (Google) attack the spam problem.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He makes his spam filter sound so easy. If it was so easy, why didn't he just
write a spam filter and make more money? It feels like he is oversimplfying the
problem.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Spammers will continue to make money as long as people keep clicking on their
links. That is crazy to me.

# Chapter 9

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Chapter talks about the characteristics of good design. Graham argues that
  good design is something that can be measured.
* Graham also brings up that a lot of great designers tend to happen in chunks
  and it is a bit random where things happen. Things happen where a lot of
  people want to solve intersting problems.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

A surprising idea was that great design looks the same across fields. You would
that design would mean different things, however great design at it's core is
very simple. Everything else that defines great design in it's field is related
to it's core principles.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why are people clumped together in a community solving problems. It feels like
they are drawn to each. That seems like the wrong answer.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I feel like his explanation about what a "great artist" was when we are
children is incorrect. He just throws in what kids probably believe. His
argument is sound, this one does not.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

He brings up the point that people that are great at anything make it seem
easy. It's not that it's easy, it's that they put in so much work that it feels
natural. People's subconcious has taken over easy tasks so their conscious can
focus on solving hard problems.

# Chapter 10

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter is about programming language types: machine langugages and
  high-level languages.
* He also talks about the current language wars: static vs. dynamic typing,
  oop vs. non-oop
* Also he brings up the langugage renaissance, which is the explosion of
  languages that is occuring today.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Nothing surprised me or stood out because I have heard all of these arguments
before.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What is the best language?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Paul Graham believes that OSS is the holy grail of software development. OSS
has it's downfalls mainly that people are not getting paid to do something,
which means that they are not doing it full-time. He even said that for
something to be excellent you need no less than 100% commitment. OSS has both
it's good and bad.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Libraries for a language may be more important that the core language. What a
language allows you to build on top of it is the most important thing.

# Chapter 11

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about what it would take to create a language that would
  be useful 100 years from now.
* Those things are keeping a language simple meaning keeping the constructs of
  the language a small number and taking advantage of the speed of computers in
  the future.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

How wasteful we are today with computer speed. I knew this to be true, however
it was surprising when he said, "I can remember taking all the spaes out of my
Basic programs so they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80". That just
tells us how we skip our thought process around how fast our computers are.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why do we use programming languages as the notation to talk to computers and
why is it safe to assume that we'll be using the same notation 100 years in the
future.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He argues about certain languages need certain criteria and how people are
pigeon-holed into thinking like a language, yet I feel like he is the same way
with LISP.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Whatever langauge we use now or in the future must be easy to use. Any
restrictions imposed on us by the language will need to be stripped away if the
language is meant to be "successful"

# Chapter 12

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about the paradox of developers knowing that their
  language is more powerful that other languages and not knowing which
  languages are more powerful than their own.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That developers don't know when other languages are more powerful than their
own. They view other languages as weird and less powerful.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Based on Graham's paradox, is it true that a language that is more powerful
than Lisp exists and he is unable to see it?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think that his opinion is outdated or for developers that are new to
software. Hackers these days are thrown into a world were they have to use many
different languages to get the job done. If another language has something more
powerful, they can use a language that compiles down to bytecode or compiles it
to another interpreted language. The line between languages are blurring. Even
completely separate languages can pass around data and method calls using
things like protocol buffers.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Use the most powerful language available to you. Language choice matter only in
that it gives you the right tools for the task.

# Chapter 13

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* This chapter talks about why Lisp is a superior language and why it's wise to
  use it.
* The features that differentiate Lisp are listed and it's interesting to note
  that the majority of the features of the language created in 1958 are found
  in modern languages.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

A lot of the features in Lisp are present in modern languages. I think the
biggest one that stands out is garbage collection. There have been arguments
that garbage collection was one of the things that increased productivity in
the past 10 years. It's crazy that Lisp already had it.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why did Lisp not become a mainstream language if it has all of these powerful
features?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

He explains the power of Lisp based on returning a function, which is probably
too general an idea. I still believe that the power of a language is limted by
the libraries available to it. If a library doesn't exist, you can certainly
make one in the language that you are using.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

That Lisp had everything in a language that I consider to be standard in a
language that I would want to use.

# Chapter 14

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* Graham lists what the characteristics of a dream language are: simple, not
  verbose, libraries, open source, good community, quick to prototype, and lots
  of abstractions that make sense to hackers. It has a built in profiler and
  perhaps tells you when you are algorithms are not optimized. If the language
  lets you write inline code to optimize, even better.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That profilers need to be built into the language. I was in the camp that
profilers are addons to a language. Yout always need a profiler, why not build
it into the language?

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does he consider Lisp to be a dream language? I half-expected him to say that
Lisp has almost all of these qualifications.

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Committees aren't always a bad thing. I think a lot of great software is
written in the open source community by committee. I think you just need to the
right people on the committee. I mean HTML 5 has a committee.
**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Coming from Java, writing short code that is quick to prototype is a must have
for a language. I have felt this before and now I understand why I felt that
way. I want to just hack on things quickly and not be bothered with all of
the mental startup cost.

# Chapter 15

**Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

* In anything that you hack on, design must be done for users because users
  will say whether what you made was good or not.
* An iterative approach, release early and often, is a successful model and has
  roots in the arts.
* If you design something that you want to use, you often make something
  awesome.

**What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I didn't know that release early and often has roots in the arts. The ability
to constantly refine something is important and it makes so much sense that
it's applicable everywhere.

**What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What other "truths" in the world can be applied to software? Are there any
other art techinques that can be brought to hacking?

**Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't think that you always need to design something that you yourself want
to use. It just makes it easier to design something great.

**What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

Release early and often. Worse is better. If you want something to be great,
don't take forever to make it. Users will tell you if it sucks or not.
