Chapter 1
Why Nerds Are Unpopular

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd
- Smart kids don't want to be popular
- No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it
- Nerds don't realize it takes work to be popular
- Nerds are unpopular because they have other things to think about
- Children create a crude, savage society for themselves (Lord of the Flies)
- The real world is more hospitable to nerds, because nerds get the right answers
- Nerds clump and create meritocracies in the real world
- Children lack real work, and school serves as more of a prison than an institution for learning
- The mediocrity of American public schools drives kids away from learning
- There is nothing inevitable about the current system, it has come about mostly by default
- School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

Paul Graham states several time that teenagers have little to offer the real world and I disagree wholeheartedly. We seem to have abandoned apprenticeships in the modern age but I can't think of a compelling reason they couldn't be revived.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

What does Graham suggest we do about it? He says that the present educational system seems to have come about by default, but his only suggestion (in a footnote) is to make it more like college. That is hardly actionable.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

In addition to my previous objection to his claim that teenagers are useless, I disagree with Graham's assertion that most adults in education are too apathetic or aloof to affect change in the system. I think a great many people who find themselves in primary education are there because they care deeply, and we need to find better ways to empower them in their efforts.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it
- Being a nerd today is a very different prospect than this, although it mostly rings true for me.



Chapter 2
Hackers and Painters

- Hacking and Painting have a lot in common
- There is no such thing as Computer Science
- Hackers build things using code as their medium, much as a painter uses paint
- What you do and how you do it should not be separated
- The people building the system should also be designing it
- Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry
- Hacking is about making, not implementing
- Static typed languages would be valuable if we knew what we were going to code before we started
- Separating system design from development decreases the standard deviation of the outcome
- If you want to build great software start your own company
- You learn to hack by doing it
- Makers learn by example
- Programs shouldn't work from a concrete specification; the spec should be malleable
- Hacking comes in cycles, sometimes work is fascinating and other times nothing seems interesting

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

I'm not entirely convinced that computer science doesn't exist. I understand Graham's point that generally we call just about anything involving programming computer science and that it is too broad a term, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that computer science doesn't exist.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

What can be done to allow the specification to be owned and implemented by hackers and fulfill the enterprise requirement of a low standard deviation?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Only that I do believe programming in many flavors is in fact a science.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Save bugs for times when motivation decreases to prevent a total halt, and slow down on projects you're excited about to prevent burnout.



Chapter 3
What You Can't Say

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Throughout history we have always considered certain thoughts or topics to be taboo
- We believe things that people in the future will find ridiculous
- Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of your peers? If the answer is no then you most likely just think whatever you're told
- Taboos can be found by looking for specific words; in other times: heresy, defeatist, blasphemy, sacrilege, sexist
- At Harvard in the early 90s it was considered inappropriate to complement a colleaugue or student on their attire
- Most adults give children a deliberately misleading view of the world
- Americans don't need taboos to protect them, nor do the English. Coprophiles are not numerous or energetic enough to enforce taboos and be promoted to a lifestyle
- The greatest sources of moral taboos are power struggles where one side barely has the upper hand
- WWII was a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism, unless you count the USSR among the victors
- Graham explores taboo ideas out of curiosity, and is especially interested in the forbidden
- He does it because it's good for the brain. To do good work you need a brain that can go anywhere
- Natural selection, for example. It's so simple.
- Look for places where conventional wisdom is broken and then try to pry apart the cracks. 
- Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.
- Make a point of encouraging the most outrageous thoughts you can imagine inside your own head.
- Have a few close friends you can say heretical things to
- Disagree with zealots without being specific, or counterattack with metaphor
- Some people use 'negative' or 'destructive' instead of wrong to describe dangerous ideas that are beyond the scope of their open-mindedness
- It is the nature of fashion to be invisible
- Adults have perspective on their own thoughts. Unlike children they are able to examine them at a distance.
- How can you see the wave, when you're the water?

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )	

It doesn't necessarily surprise me that it is difficult to see the wave when you're the water, but I'm not sure I've applied the concept directly to formative thought.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

Why is it necessary to have a brain that can go anywhere in order to do good work? It seems to me that conformists with perfectly average ideas regularly do good work.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Graham states that those who don't have opinions they would be reluctant to express in front of their peers most likely think whatever they're told. I think there are certainly people who are comfortable expressing their views anywhere and anytime who do daring, interesting and thought-leading work. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.
- How can you see the wave, when you're the water?



Chapter 4
Good Bad Attitude

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Hack: ugly solution / brilliant solution
- Intellectual curiosity is a rare motive for crime
- The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas.
- Florence is famous because it used to be like New York
- America is congenial to the right kind of unruliness
- Lately Hackerliness seems to have been frowned upon
- A society in which people can do or say what they want is also a society where the best ideas will win, and the nation will grow wealthy
- Hackers can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

The suggestion that countries find material wealth by adopting civil liberties. There is one quite large counterexample brewing on the other side of the Pacific.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

Why isn't China's economy affected by their lack of civil liberties?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

I don't think that Americans are the only people who think dangerous thoughts, just the most likely to be caught expressing them on an international pulpit.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas
- Hackers can sense totalitarianism approaching from a distance
- I hope that good ideas continue to win, but I'm willing to spend the rest of my life battling bad ones



Chapter 5
The Other Road Ahead

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- I think a lot of the next generation of software will be written on this model (web apps)
- It will take about .1sec for a click to get to the web server and back
- Computing is moving to the cloud
- You should expect to be able to test drive any application for free (freemium)
- Developers (in the future) will have to design software so it can be updated without confusing the user
- At Viaweb I doubt we ever had more than 10 known bugs at a time
- Web based software should be less vulnerable to viruses
- Designing web-based software is like designing a city rather than a building
- Some of the Viaweb system was made of a lack of software, because they deleted unix utilities
- When you have competitors, 'you can' means 'you must'
- Many of the failures of desktop software are related to the way it is released
- With web based software there are no versions
- Let the users debug your software
- Since you can diagnose bugs instantly you can find and fix most errors as soon as they appear
- Viaweb never had enough bugs to bother with a tracking system (it was made of pixie dust)
- Functional programming means avoiding side effects
- Viaweb had FREE SUPPORT!!! so they could find bugs and fix them
- Few projects at Viaweb took longer than two weeks
- Shelving an idea costs you all of the ideas that would have popped up if you'd addressed it (as ideas start flowing when you intend to add one item to a todo list)
- Plans are shelved ideas. If you have a good idea, implement it.
- Web-based software requires fewer programmers
- In web development you only need the new product development staff of 13 people, at most
- Adding people to a project tends to slow it down (Mythical Man Month)
- Web applications are never going to be something you write, check-in and go home
- With server-based software you can watch actual users
- In web applications the back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems
- If a user wouldn't have bought your software anyway and uses a pirated copy, you gain, as they help make your software the standard (and will probably buy it someday)
- You'll sell more of something when it's easy to buy; if it's difficult it will affect desire
- You have to be administering the servers; if you give up direct control of the servers you give up most of the advantages of web-based software
- Storing credit card information yourself is the equivalent of keeping your life savings under your mattress and saying it's safer than at the bank because you have direct control
- Outsource any job that isn't directly exposed to competitive pressure
- Some companies will pay more for software because it costs more to sell to them (enterprise)
- VisiCalc was evidence of the evolution in software caused by inexpensive development machines (desktops rather than mainframes)
- Viaweb paid $16k/month for PR
- "If Apple were to grow the iPod into a cell phone with a web browser Microsoft would be in big trouble" - Paul Graham, 2004
- Microsoft will be hampered on the web by trying to save the desktop
- Since web apps never ship you can work 16 hour days forever, and because you can you must if you have competitors
- Programmers are unlikely to dedicate themselves fully unless it is their own company.
- HTML and HTTP are just good enough
- Clients don't matter if you're web-based, the web will continue to work for a long time
- Web applications make the odds significantly better for startups
- Why not start your own company? You know nothing about business and you're afraid of competition; neither of these fences have any current in them.
- Everything you need to know about business: Build something users love and make more than you spend
- You can launch a web-based startup now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair
- Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to use yourself
- Get a version 1.0 (but without the versions?) out fast then continuously improve the software based on user input - MVP
- The best software is easy, but achieve this by getting the correct defaults not limiting users' choices
- Compare your software to what it could be, not to what your competitors build
- Use your own product all the time
- Don't listen to marketing people or designers or product people just because of their job titles
- If you can't design software as well as implement it don't start a startup
- "What's scary about Microsoft is that a company so big can develop software at all. They're like a mountain that can walk."
- Microsoft is scared of you

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

A lot of this chapter seemed like common sense to me, and it took me looking up the publication date of 2004 to understand how prophetic this was at the time. He more or less predicts the development of the iPhone and describes the cloud and web applications quite well.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

- Developers (in the future) will have to design software so it can be updated without confusing the user

This makes perfect sense, and Graham suggests that this is a solved problem without any details.

- In web applications the back button becomes one of your most interesting philosophical problems

I can guess what this means but it would only be a guess unless Graham provides a few details.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- You have to be administering the servers; if you give up direct control of the servers you give up most of the advantages of web-based software. 

Obviously Heroku proved Graham wrong in this case, at least in my opinion. I don't think that modern hackers need to be system administrators, and most of the happiest hackers I know have nothing to do with SA.

Chapter 6
How to Make Wealth

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Why do startups typically work with high technology?
- The time quantum for hacking is very long, so startups have an advantage in uninterruptible time
- A good hacker working without any corporate bullshit should be able to do $3 million worth of work in a year
- "Bulk discount if you buy the economy-sized pain"
- Billionaires are incredibly smart, and incredibly dedicated AND incredibly lucky
- This essay is about how to create wealth and get paid for it; you have to do something people want
- Wealth is not money. Wealth is what you want, money is how you get it.
- If you make violins and none of the local farmers wants one how do you eat?
- Want to find a good idea? Dodge your interests and you are more likely to find something others will need
- Wealth is created everyday. We are not working from a finite pie
- Productivity immediately affects wealth creation, and ranges from negative to millions a month for programmers
- Hackers donate wealth by writing open source software
- Nearly all companies exist to do something people want
- Making something people want is what matters, not joining a group/company
- The biggest problem in large companies is assigning value to everyone's work, they mostly average
- To get rich you need measurement and leverage.
- If there is a big potential for gain there must be a terrifying possibility for loss
- In large groups individual efforts are not recognized, the weak slow the strong and the average member of a large group will be average. Small groups can be extraordinary
- Technology is the technique that makes a startup
- RUN UPSTAIRS
- Startup - n: Working incredibly hard on difficult problems when you are 30 times more productive and barely achieving your goal. 
- At every decision point, take the harder choice.
- A startup is like a mosquito, and a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score
- It is easier to sell an established startup, even at an inflated rate, than an early one
- Get users. Acquiring companies will judge you by how many users you have because they are the best indicator that you have created wealth
- A restaurant can afford to burn the occasional dinner but in a startup you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats
- A startup is, economically, a way of saying I want to work faster for more wealth
- Let the nerds keep their lunch money and you rule the world

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- The time quantum for hacking is very long, so startups have an advantage in uninterruptible time

It honestly didn't occur to me the huge productivity gain that working with a small team in a single office will afford in a startup

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do world governments affect startups when they primarily occupy a global space?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

I think in some respects we are still working from a finite pie, but it is more of a power pie than a wealth pie, and the power is given more opportunity to decide where and how the wealth gets made. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- At every decision point, take the harder choice.
- Get users. Acquiring companies will judge you by how many users you have because they are the best indicator that you have created wealth

Chapter 7
Mind the Gap

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- In a modern society variation in income is actually a sign of health
- Wealth is created by the people. Children confuse it with money because it is given to them. 
- It does not seem unreasonable the a CEO is worth 100 times the average worker bee
- In a free market prices are determined by what people want, so if we say one type of work is overpaid we are saying people want the wrong things.
- For most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it
- Only after the Industrial Revolution did wealth creation replace corruption as the best way to get rich
- Technology will increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive
- The rate at which technology increases our productivity rate is polynomial
- Brand is the residue as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate
- Idleness is lonely and demoralizing; the rich work anyway
- A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable 
- England had a 98% tax on investment income in 1974
- Henry Ford will make you a tractor to replace your horse if you let him get rich

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- For most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it
I find it interesting that people may create negative associations with wealth as a result

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How do we stop the on/off cycle that led England to implement a 98% tax?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Not so much a disagreement as a statement that nothing I read in this chapter explains the fact that we have seen a drastic shift in wealth towards the wealthiest Americans over the last two decades. Is it possible that technology played a role?

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- Brand is the residue as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate
- Idleness is lonely and demoralizing; the rich work anyway
- A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are simply much more valuable 



Chapter 8
A Plan for Spam

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Graham did not consider spam a solved problem in 2004
- Bright red is as good an indicator of spam as any pornographic term
- How many points should an email get for having the word sex in it?
- This is the spec for GMail, Graham was clearly not in the beta

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

The fact that this chapter exists surprises me, it is absurdly out of place. 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

How does an essay on spam filtering seem so relevant to the discussion of modern computing that it deserves an entire chapter?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

The content is sound, but adds little to the book.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

Don't ever include a chapter on spam filtering in my books.



Chapter 9
Taste for Makers

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- How to make beautiful things
- If your job is to design things and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job.
- If taste is just personal preference than everybody is already perfect.
- Good design is timeless
- If something appeals to people from 1500 it will appeal to people in 2500
- To keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortune
- Good design looks easy
- In software a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way
- Good design resembles nature
- Good design is redesign
- Good design can copy
- Good design is often strange
- Good design can happen in chunks
- At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it's nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you're too far removed from one of these centers (move to San Jose)
- Good design is often daring
- It's easier to see ugliness than imagine beauty

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- If something appeals to people from 1500 it will appeal to people in 2500

This warrants a little more explanation. There was a time when cod pieces were quite popular.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

- It's easier to see ugliness than imagine beauty
How is this relevant to original design beyond the incremental improvement of code? When a new algorithm is written and it seems ugly does it preclude beauty in the implementation?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- If taste is just personal preference than everybody is already perfect.

Graham seems to be suggesting that in order for design to be a worthwhile pursuit there much be such a thing as absolute beauty, though I think of good design as catering to popular opinion rather than seeking some ideal. Indeed even the most beautiful things of the last century would have wildly varying degrees of approval today. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
- Good design is timeless
- At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it's nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you're too far removed from one of these centers (move to San Jose)

Chapter 10
Programming Languages Explained

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Machine/Assembly language
- Machine language is unique to the computer, high-level languages are portable
- When you really need reliability, there are solid business reasons for insisting on open source
- Inexperienced programmers' opinions of other languages are often skewed by their inability to stop thinking in their native language
- A language that lets you do X is at least as good as one that forces you to
- Graham is a duck

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Graham is a duck
I don't know why but I would not have guessed Paul Graham was a duck typing proponent.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

He didn't seem to delve into the interpreted vs. compiled language discussion.

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

Given that this is more of a factual account than some other chapters I didn't object to anything.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )

- A language that lets you do X is at least as good as one that forces you to



Chapter 11
The Hundred-Year Language

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- We can use present performance to predict languages with staying power
- The language of the future will likely be lazy about preserving resources
- Language design is being taken over by hackers
- Because we can program today as though our hardware doesn't matter, it is concievable that the language we use 100 years from now could be written today

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Language design is being taken over by hackers
I wouldn't have imagined that languages weren't always designed by hackers.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

If the language of the future can be written today why don't we have it already?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- Language design is being taken over by hackers
I think academics can be considered hackers, even the mathematicians, therefore the hackers have always been involved in the creation of languages. There is certainly a distinction to be made here, but I don't like the way he makes it.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
- When driving you aim for some point in the distance, rather than trying to keep it inside the lines within the next 10 feet.

Chapter 14
The Dream Language

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis
- How do languages become popular? 20 is critical mass, but getting there is more difficult than 20-1000
- Whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, it must be popular to be good
- To become popular, a scripting language must be a scripting language of a popular system
- Language implementations must be free, because companies pay for software but hackers don't
- Programming languages must have a book, preferably from O'Reilly
- Greater levels of abstraction mean fewer tokens and less typing. Hackers are lazy.
- Hackability: you must be able to use the language to accomplish whatever you want
- Assume your target user is a genius who will do things you can't anticipate
- A good program language should let hackers do unsavory things
- A language should be good for writing throw away programs
- When people take on a project that is too big they get overwhelmed, the project gets bogged down or the result is sterile and wooden
- A good language needs libraries, future languages may have libraries as well developed as the core itself (sound like ruby?)
- When libraries get too big it may take longer to find the function you need than it does to write it yourself (unless it's on github)
- As Knuth pointed out long ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.
- A good profiler may do more to improve speed than the compiler
- Future languages should provide a way to see bottlenecks in the source, or notify the user at runtime
- Many applications of the future will be IO bound
- Languages need time; most hackers will wait to see if a language survives for a few years before considering it
- The early adopter years are useful to flush out bugs
- Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders than the big bang method
- Languages don't get redesigned often enough
- Hope and worry drive work like two legs on a bicycle
- Language design by committee is a bad idea
- The Dream Language is not only open source, but open design

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )

- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis
I would have assumed that all tyrannies claim to be exercised for the good of their victims, but I assume some particularly oppressive tyrants would be happy to voice their malicious intent.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

In Hackability Graham suggests a good language will allow a hacker to do whatever they want; surely some constraints are necessary?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

- When libraries get too big it may take longer to find the function you need than it does to write it yourself
Even large libraries today are frequently stored online in very readable formats, so this is probably not the case anymore.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of it's victims may be the most oppressive. - C.S. Lewis
- Hope and worry drive work like two legs on a bicycle. The worry makes it good.
- The Dream Language is not only open source, but open design

Chapter 15
Design and Research

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

- What do you do differently when you treat languages as a design problem rather than a research topic?
- Focus on the user
- Give the users what they need, not necessarily whatever they want
- The design will be best if the designer is also a user (he advised against this earlier)
- Some ideas are easy for people to grasp and some aren't, details for example are hard on humans
- Languages with a toplevel are more convenient and static typing is generally incompatible
- Jane Austen read her novels outloud to her family
- Worse is Better, get a prototype in front of users as quickly as possible MVP
- Morale is key in design
- Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged
- A painting is never finished. You just stop working on it.
- Design means making things for humans, but it's not just the user who is human. The designer is human too
