Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular

1) 	- Nerds are unpopular because popularity is not inherent, but rather requires a time and mental commitment that nerds apply elsewhere.
	- One of the causes of this is that school is no longer particularly useful for kids, but is rather a holding pen until their parents are done with work.
2) The idea that stood out to me was placing the blame on the school system. While bullying has often been blamed on schools, it is typically accusing them of a lack of control/discipline over their students. This was the first time that I had seen someone try to correlate bullying with school's lack of usefullness.
3) I thought that the end of the chapter, where Paul said that things could be fixed but that people didn't really care to do so, should have been followed up with how he thought things should be fixed, instead of simply saying that "adults are busy."
4) My main objection was that the bulk of the chapter seemed to be based on Paul's generational experience in schools, and not necessarily how they are today. Specifically, he based much of the chapter on the assumption that all (or almost all) nerds are smart and all popular kids are not. In my experience, there were a great many smart popular kids, and just as many stupid geeky kids.
5) 	- School has devolved from useful apprenticeships to something more like babysitting.
	- For kids in school, popularity is as much about effort as it is about inherent qualities.


Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

1)	- Hackers are more like painters (or other makers) than computer scientists
	- Hackers feel the need to create, continue to learn from others, and often need to satisfy their needs away from their day jobs
2) I was struck by the idea at the end of the chapter that we won't really know for a while the value of hacking, much like we only now know the value of certain artists. To anyone doing any sort of work, the value seems to be apparent in the moment, so it is disconcerting/exciting to think that we may not know as much as we think we do.
3) Paul argues that hackers do not belong in academia, because it does not allow them to do what they really want. Yet there is so much crossover between the two. Are these really all hackers just waiting out their "day jobs", or have some found a way to create while still providing value to the university.
4) I don't particularly object to it, but from the arguments that I have seen over the benefits different team structures in coding, I would imagine many would disagree with his statement that teams should sharply define which module each member is working on.
5)	- Hacking is not a science, but rather an art that depends heavily on knowledge.

Chapter 3 - What You Can't Say

1) 	- Ideas about what is right/wrong have drastically changed over time
	- We have the tendency to assume that the current wisdom is the correct one.
	- It is important to question things, but also equally important to pick your battles.
2) I thought it was interesting that he argued that ideas do not necessarily represent progress, but rather fashion. We tend to think that our opinions are better/'more correct' than previous generations, but there is no reason this actually has to be the case. Perhaps if we considered this possibility more often, people would be more willing to discuss alternative ideas.
3) He advises that, for the most part, if you disagree with ideas you should keep them to yourself. However, most big ideas are not just in your head, they also determine your actions. So, if you disagree with current cultural opinion, it is difficult to keep to yourself without acting in a manner contrary to what you believe.
4) I thought he gave scientists a bit too much credit for pushing the envelope. I believe that most scientists have a strong incentive not to rock the boat too much.
5)	- If everything you believe is what you are supposed to believe, you are probably not thinking enough.

Chapter 4 - Good Attitude, Bad Attitude
1) 	- Hacking is really about intellectual curiosity
	- While restricting civil liberties may protect certain people in the short term, in the long term it will restrict ideas.
2) When I think of America's current attitude toward questionable hacking, I typically think of things like music companies suing teenagers and SOPA. It was suprising to me that Paul praised America's current feelings toward hacking, particularly compared with other countries.
3) How much freedom (i.e. piracy or questionable sharing of content) is too much, even if that freedom promotes innovation?
4) I agreed with most of the chapter, with the cavaet that it is easy to bash all copyright and intellectual property laws without offering an alternative solution.
5)	- Civil liberties are not necessarily an effect of a thriving society, they may also be the cause
	- Restrictive intellectual property laws may protect companies, but they will also squash innovation

Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead
1)	- The future of software will be web-based. Fewer and fewer programs will be installed directly on one's hard drive
	- This structure will create better products, a better customer experience, and will drive innovation.
2) I was struck by the thought that larger companies are more scared of startups than the other way around. So many people worry about what would happen if a Google or Microsoft entered their market, but in reality it is much easier for a small company rethink things on the fly than it would be for one of the giants.
3) Are there any advantages to sticking with non-hosted software?
4) I didn't really disagree with anything in this chapter. Basically, what Paul predicted is exactly what is occuring now.
5)	- Smaller, web-based companies have severe advantages over any sort of large, user-hosted software company
	- Paul Graham nailed this prediction right on the head.

Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth
1)	- A startup is basically choosing to work really hard for a few years, as opposed to working moderately for many years
	- Programmers can create wealth by writing software
	- To achieve the goal of working harder for more money, you need both measurability and leverage
2) I liked that Paul discussed the need for measurability and leverage within a company. I think too many people rely on their ability to work harder for a proportional benefit, without considering if their efforts will be rewarded. I certainly found that when I worked at a company whose employees lacked these characteristics, my motivation was substantially decreased.
3) Is it possible to scale your company while maintaining the ability for employee efforts to be rewarded? I think this is exactly the question that LivingSocial is encountering now.
4) I disagreed with the arguement that you should definitely sell your company. I think the rewards of building many companies are best paid out over time, particularly because most people who sell their company jump right back into another one.
5)	- Wealth can be created, not only distributed.
	- Working harder is certainly worth it, provided you have measurability and leverage.

Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap
1)	- Variability in wealth is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather an indication of incentives to create wealth
	- While technology extends the wealth gap, it decreases the social gap
	- If you switch off ability to create wealth, you switch off innovation
2) I liked the point that saying a certain kind of work is over/underpaid is equivalent to saying that people want the wrong things. I feel like I've often had discussions defending the high pays of athletes etc. based on the principles of supply and demand. Framing it this way, as opposed to just blaming the organizations that pay so much, puts an interesting spin on it.
3) I wonder how Paul would feel about the current most hated group of highly paid individuals: bankers. Would he feel that they too had created their wealth or would he, like many, feel that some of them were closer to stealing wealth.
4) Not directly. I've always taken more a a supply and demand approach toward this topic, which is similar but not the same to his argument.
5)	- The income gap is not something that we should try to avoid, but something that is necessary for innovation

Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam
1)	- Paul proposes filtering spam based on Bayesian probability filters, as opposed to setting up individual rules
2) I like the idea that spam filters could be customized to an individual inbox. I tend to think of most anti-spam/malware software as one-size-fits all, while there is no reason that they shouldn't be individualized.
3) How does this method relate to what Gmail is now doing with guessing which of your emails are important?
4) No. I was a bit suprised at this chapter, because it did not seem to fit with the philisophical tone of the rest of the book.
5)	- Perhaps spam is best dealt with through a machine-learning algorithm
	- If we use this approach, it will actually evolve as spam itself evolves

Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers
1) 	- While many believe that taste is subjective, there is a such thing as good design
	- Good design has consistent qualities, which Paul discusses in turn
2) The idea that one way to create good design is to design for both people now and previous generations was interesting to me. It's something I've never heard before but makes perfect sense. It also, to some degree, explains why so many fashions are retro oriented.
3) Is there a point when good design copies too much?
4) I disagreed with the notion that shorter is necessarily better, particularly in programming. I think that, at a certain point, length must be balanced with clarity.
5) 	- Great design often happens in chunks, when a community of talented people is working on the same problem. Hopefully, this is the sort of community that we are helping to create.

Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained
1)	- Programming languages are on a spectrum of machine level to high level, and have different levels of abstractness and permissions
	- Open source languages have many advantages, including the fact that bugs get fixed much faster
	- Despite what some may say, there are certainly better and worse languages
2) I liked that he said that it was nonsense that all languages are equal. It seems clear that some are better than others, yet there will always be people arguing the contrary.
3) I would have liked to know more about what he thought the future of languages would be. -- Although he sort of answers this in the next chapter
4) I disagreed with the thought that we would definitely be worse off if more people were using the same language. While this may create more roadblocks to innovation, it would help solve many problems (i.e. electronic health records integration).
5)	- A language that allows you do something will always be better than a language that forces you to do it.

Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language
1) 	- As hardware improves, languages will likely make things easier to program at the expense of efficiency
	- The simpler a language is at its core, the more useful it will be
2) I thought that goal of developing a language that was both easy to generate version 1 and had the ability to scale up in optimization was a good way of describing what the ideal language might be. As far as I understand, one of the criticisms of Rails is that it has the first quality, but not the second (although I know many disagree with that).
3) Are there any specific characteristics of current languages that he thinks will or will not be part of future languages?
4) I thought his view that we would not use hardware improvements like parallel processing may not have been giving programmers enough credit. So far, it seems as if every innovation squeezes everything it can out of the hardware available.
5)	- As hardware evolves, we will be able to use languages that are easier for us to write, and harder for the machine to interpret
	- The future of languages is almost certainly in open-source

Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages
1) 	- There is certainly a hierarchy of languages, and Lisp is the most powerful one
	- Lisp was the reason Viaweb was able to beat out its competitors
2) I was suprised that Paul gave Lisp so much credit for Viaweb's success. It seems almost too good to be true the way he described how its power allowed him to write in days what took other companies months.
3) Would Paul still feel so strongly about Lisp if he looked at the menu of programming languages today?
4) I tend to be skeptical when someone says that X is always the best choice, regardless of scenario. I feel that it is much more likely that Lisp is the best tool for some applications, but other languages will allow better and faster development in other situations.
5)  - Lisp is certainly worth examining sometime, if only to understand why it might be advantageous over other languages.

Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds
1)	- New programming languages are only now approaching the level of power that Lisp has
	- Using Lisp allows you to generate programs faster and beat your competitors
2) While I'm not sure I entirely agree with it, I thought it was quite suprising at how differences in languages can lead to enormous differences in production time. This particularly suprised me because I feel like many companies just pick any language, and do not consider the magnitude of their decision.
3) If Lisp is so great, why aren't more people using it? Why do we keep writing new languages that approach it instead?
4) I don't know enough about Lisp or programming languages in general to be sure, but I am always suspicious of an argument that leaves no room for discussions or exceptions. I would bet that there are downsides to using Lisp that Paul is not covering.
5)	- Choosing the correct language for the job can be the difference between you beating your competitors, and your competitors beating you.

Chapter 14 - The Dream Language
1) 	- There are common qualities to any successful language, including succinctness, hackability, and libraries
	- Any new language should offer free implementation, a book, and something to hack
	- New languages take time to be adopted
	- Lays out the characteristics of a dream language
2) The idea that a language must encourage throwaway programs was interesting to me. I had never thought of that before, but it makes perfect sense that a great many projects start as whims, and only eventually evolve into full fledged software. Particularly in the "fail fast" environment of tech today, any language that does not allow fast prototyping is not going to work.
3) How much of the success of a language is determined by these characteristics, and how much is pure luck? It seems to me that many have tried to fulfill these standards, but only a few languages have risen to the top.
4) Paul argues that a good language needs to be part of a platform, and that you should not have to download it specifically. I disagree with this notion, as many people, including myself, have no problem configuring their environment to support a new language if they want to try it.
5) 	- There are common characteristics to any great language
	- Moving forward, the standards for any new language are going to be very high

Chapter 15 - Design and Research
1)	- In designing software, it is imperative to focus on the user
	- Remember that the user is a human, not a machine
	- Stay close to your users throughout the design process
	- Building software that is always working to some degree is much better for morale, leads to a better product
2) I liked that Paul makes the distinction between what the customer needs and what the customer wants. I think that too many people blindly follow the Steve Jobs approach of "I'll tell people what they want", without considering that they still need to adhere to the adage that the customer is always right, just in a different sense.
3) The approach in this chapter seems similar to a Lean Startup approach. Are there any instances where this is not the best way to do things (i.e. where it is better to wait to release the product until it is more refined?)
4) Paul claims that he has never heard of a "Hail Mary" case that worked. I very much doubt that this is the case. A few companies were bound to get lucky, regardless of whether or not they should have been doing things this way.
5)	- Morale is a huge key to the design process. If you are not continually interested in what you are doing, you will not create a great product.
