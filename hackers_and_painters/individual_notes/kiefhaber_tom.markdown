<h1> Chapter 1 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Popularity in high school is painful contest that never lets up
* Being smart isn't the problem, it's that nerds are busy thinking about other things rather than popularity.
* When you don't focus on popularity every second, you are an easy target
* Top of heap doesn't bother bottom because not a threat. It's the lower rungs that really bust their chops. 
* High school is basically just a holding tank slash prison slash older person day care
* Teens learn nothing so they're bored and don't respect elders, adults have no use for kids, so can't relate to the struggles. 

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I was surprised by the cynicism of the author on his outlook on high school. Granted, it is probably more accurate than most would like to admit.  I had a very different school experience.  Found that though I can't remember much of the specifics of high school, I feel I did learn a lot about how to think and analyze. Popularity was an issue, but not as brutal as described by the author.</li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> He talks a lot about finding a solution to this problem, but offers no ideas. It's clear he has some up his sleeve, so it would be nice for him to throw some out there.</li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No full objections, just think its a very bleak outlook on the future of our nation.</li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
* Being smart doesn't cause nerdiness
* Those who pick on nerds are most threatened
* Most would elect to be smart instead of popular if that were the deciding factor




<h1> Chapter 2 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Computer science is the ultimate misnomer
* Creators are creators.  They get better through practice and iteration.
* Scientists recreate work others have done until they get good, then they get original
* Empathy is important, but practicing that doesn't mean you have to ultimately not do what you want
* What sets you art from other coders is the attention to detail. Like the woman with the leaves.

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I was surprised that this chapter wasn't a more widely held opinion in the world.  As a video person, I like to create. Block it out, refine it over time. That's why I felt like this jump would make sense for me. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> No questions unanswered except for how can you revamp the education system, but I also think he has ideas for that as well. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No, I agree with what he says in this chapter wholeheartedly. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Attention to detail. Keep the user in mind. Keep other coders in mind.  </li>




<h1> Chapter 3 </h1>
----------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Fashion changes with the times and so does moral fashion.
* What others fou d taboo in the past, we find acceptable. What we find taboo will probably seem dumb to those in the future.
* How do we figure out what is probably going to change in the future?
* confirmist test. What wouldn't you say in front of peers?
* trouble. What can't you say that is true?
* heresy. What is considered divisive or insensitive?
* time and space. Look at difference in what is taboo here and now vs what is taboo in past or other cultures. Harvard example of complimenting people on clothing.
* prigs. What do you get from subtracting the taboos known by a sheltered teen from a marine who's served all over the world?  Everything you're not supposed to say.
* mechanism. What do bleeding edge people reject first when breaking away from the crowd?
* Why? It's good to break convention, it's like stretching, it will help you think outside the box. 
* Know your audience. Shut up and just think it if necessary, and discuss with trusted friends
* Challenge from afar. Challenge the abstract idea, not the heresy
* Take a look from afar, always question

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I'm surprised that more people aren't doing this.  In a society where everything had to be PC, a teacher can't give a student a high5 for doing something right, it's amazing we can still find a way to interact.  Maybe that's why everyone spends all their time texting and emailing and on the Internet. It's an easy way to cover your bases. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What about things like racism. Sure, looking at the times, we think that slavery is terrible, but I truly don't think that this is a pendulum swinging. This is something that won't revert.  Hopefully other topics become less touchy, though, otherwise we will be a world full of the biggest pansies in history. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Disagreement in answer above referring to racism. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li>Use litmus tests to see if something is a moral trend, ask why, challenge, but don't feel a need to take a stance. Keep it in your head.</li>




<h1> Chapter 4 </h1>
--------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* hackers pre-date computers (safe crackers)
* hacking is American, because it is basically why America was formed

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I'm not very surprised by the fact that hackers like to break rules, and use current technology to build new technology. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This chapter is pretty straight forward.  No questions unanswered.  </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No disagreements </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Key takeaways are that hackers will hack, no matter what the industry and no matter what the times. </li>



<h1> Chapter 5 </h1>
---------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Writing software for browser has many advantages over writing for an OS.
* People deal with more inconveniences than necessary because they think they have to.
* People now realize that no matter what, you should be able to access your data/systems
* Everyone on the same version, bugs fixed in real time, less vulnerability, etc
* Many, many apps are the way to go, not just one large one.
* Releases all the time, instead of once a year.
* Hardware you can choose
* Choose your own programming language
* Bugs found and fixed in real time, weirder the bug, more advanced the user
* Higher morale for innovative people who can get ideas live quickly
* Fewer programmers required
* Watch users helps you find pain points and problem spots
* Server based software benefits everyone, even big corps with lower up front cost, but long term constant subscription revenue
* Great power = great responsibility.  Programmers become sys-ad as well.
* Web browser is good, but only good enough.  Basically the lowest common denominator




### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Was surprised to hear him say that the browser was just good enough.  The common denominator, that isn't perfect, but works well enough to keep using it.  Hadn't thought about it in that mindset before. Also surprised to hear about added responsibility of being programmer and also sys-ad, think this is a great thing and leads to more ownership of projects. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What would be a better common denominator? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Dig this chapter, don't disagree with him.  People are moving to want more control and having a product that is agile and spry to react to needs is a must these days. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> pay attention to what your users want, have problems with 


<h1> Chapter 6 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Startup proposition is to compress your career into a few short years.  All the work, money and time goes into getting it off the ground, rather than spreading it over 30 years.
* "to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain"
* Wealth is what you want.  Money is the tool you use to trade for what you want.
* Distribution of pie is a crap analogy
* Chicks dig dudes who can make things.  Create wealth by creating something.  Not detracting from others piece of the pie.
* Measurement AND Leverage is the key.  Stay small, work hard, get paid more.
* Once you start down the path of startup, you can't stop, competitors will never stop, so you've got to be willing to stay the course the whole way.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I totally understand the use of working fast, but he's got a pretty strong view of it being be fast or die.  Like a shark that can't go under 55 mph or else it will blow up.  Also surprised that purchasers/investors are more interested in users rather than profits etc.  This makes sense now, but I hadn't thought about it that way. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> This doesn't have any cliff hangers really </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> not really </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Move quickly, work hard, hope to win the lottery. </li>



<h1> Chapter 7 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* To most, wealth = money.  Esp kids.
* Most of us create wealth for "the man", not ourselves.
* Individual worth is how much people are willing to pay for your skills.
* 100 people can't necessarily replace 1 person, because all the talent is in 1 person, not spread over 100.
* People wary of the rich because often times there is scandal related to how they made their wealth, but that's not the same as creating wealth.  That's stealing it.
* Technology makes it possible to create wealth.  By creating new technology, it gives people the ability to use that to make their own wealth.
* Ability to create wealth waxes and wanes with society and circumstances.

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I think the waves in ability to create wealth are super interesting.  It makes sense that back in the day, you'd only make enough to keep yourself alive, esp if anything on top of that would just get taken away from you.  The more options there are, the more people will explore and create technology.  </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> If wealth is not equal to money, how can we dispel the myths? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> I think this is a purely capitalist view of make your own way.  Not a lot of people are in a place where they can pull themselves up from their own bootstraps.  I am not one for handouts, but limited education in certain areas limits the likelihood that people will be able to use technology to create their own wealth. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Use what you've got to make the best possible scenario for yourself. </li>




<h1> Chapter 8 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Spam filters evolve to knock more spam out, therefore spam evolves to get past the filters.
* More important to get your false positives down to zero than it is to let a few real positives slip past the filter
* Content based filtering allows you to filter on words, colors, phrases, etc and assign probabilities to each email that it's either okay or spam.
* Bayesian method is the way to go.
* Spamming laws would be okay as well.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> How much heavy lifting that math can do.  It's amazing that a calculation can be made on a word's liklihood of spamminess and then it gets filtered out.  My approach would have been the word bank of triggers, but this seems to be the best way to filter.  Also surprised to hear that this guy is interested in limiting spammers with laws and regulations.  He spends a lot of time in other chapters giving the impression that he's not really for things like that.  Make your own wealth, don't work for the man, etc. etc. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Is the Bayesian method what people are using these days?  Why hasn't he implemented this on more accounts than his own?  Sounds like something he should sell to Google if they aren't already doing it. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> None to speak of. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Math is smarter than people, but people have to be smart enough to know which math to implement. </li>




<h1> Chapter 9 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Taste is more important than smarts.
* Good design is often the simplest solution to the problem.
* If there's extra crap in there, it's usually just a distraction for an inelegant solution.
* There are elements that make design inherently good, (symmetry, looks easy, resembles nature, solves the right problem).  
* When groups of people all dedicate time and energy to solving similar problems, you get the best out of the whole group.  It's more than the sum of its parts.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> That one of the hardest things to do is a line drawing of a face.  That good design has sense of humor in it.  Thinking about this now and it feels true.  Even if it doesn't make you laugh, the fact that people are still talking about the Mona Lisa and nobody knows is kind of an amazing chuckle that da Vinci is having from the grave. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> How do we get by with so much bad design?  Why do we keep straying from what works and follow fashion? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> He has a lot of factors in here that make good design, but I think that it's not quite as binary as he is presenting it.  There is definitely a hint of subjectivity that has to go on, because everyone has a different way of interpreting the same problem that the design is trying to fix. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Keep it simple, don't be afraid to start over. </li>





<h1> Chapter 10 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Machine language is what a computer can do.
* More you have to write to get a computer to do something, the easier it is to get bugs.
* High-level languages feed a compiler/interpreter, that translates everything into machine language.
* Lots of debate on which language to use.  

### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Not so surprising is that there is no answer other than use the one that works for the project you're working on. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Nothing.  This is kind of a puff chapter.  More of a documentation of the current status of the industry. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> There is no clear winner in languages, they all have strengths and weaknesses. </li>





<h1> Chapter 11 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Lots of languages are branching out and being invented, with varying success.
* Those closer to the trunk of the tree are the ones that will likely be used down the road.
* If you assume that there will be infinite computing power in the future, you could write code that is easier for you, but more inefficient for the computer with almost no side effects.
* Take away the parameters and knowledge of programming, how would you write the program in the future language?
* Could probably create the language of the future today, and steer the way we continue down the road.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> I hadn't thought about the fact that Final Cut could run faster and be more if the code was more efficient. I thought it was slow because I was putting in gigantic files and manipulating them to my hearts desire.  But if it were more efficient at a code level, you could do more with less render time and frustration. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Granted, this chapter simplifies the exercise in which you create the language of the future, but isn't this what people are already trying to do with the current languages that are being created?  One would assume that nobody would spend the time to write a language that they didn't think would be used by the community and used for a long time into the future.  With that mindset, what does he think people are trying to do? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Reflecting above question.  I agree that things that will live on in the future will be languages that branch closer to the trunk, but it seems that all the branches started at the trunk and branched for a reason.  On the other hand, technology changes, things become obsolete, that's the nature of evolution. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> In the future, there will be seemingly unlimited processing power, so we'll be able to make it easier for us as programmers, and rely on the computer much more. </li>





<h1> Chapter 12 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* There is a power spectrum of programming languages
* People tend to look down at the less powerful, but can't see what's above them.  Mostly think the top has lots of languages on same level as theirs.
* Lisp is top dog in his view.  It has macros and is dynamically typed.
* Like the comparison to learning Lisp and Latin for sake of enlightenment.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Surprising that he doesn't say it outright.  If it's worth learning just for the enlightenment moment of understanding it.  The enlightenment is that it is the most powerful and therefore should be used.  The proverbial juice is worth the proverbial squeeze, so to speak. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Why aren't more companies using it? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Couldn't he just be falling into the same argument he makes against other languages?  Could he be forgetting to look up the power spectrum and confusing other languages as weird beasts? </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Don't be afraid to learn the hardest thing, if it will then give you the most power in the end. </li>





<h1> Chapter 13 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Lisp was math based, got translated, boom.  Programming language.
* Others get more powerful as they evolve, by getting closer to Lisp.
* Programming language evolution tree forked and is growing back together now.
* Good programmers can squeeze more out of more powerful languages
* At a certain point a language can't reasonably create what a more powerful one can, so it's not worth the time or effort at that point.
* Take on the hardest possible problem and use the most powerful tool to do it.  Recipe for making money.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Pointy hair bosses get away with medicority at an astonishingly high rate! </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What's the entry barrier for learning Lisp?  Must be very high if people are not switching to it. </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Not enough knowledge in my aresenal to debate the validity of his arguments. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> To cut down a big tree, use a chain saw, not a hack-saw. </li>




<h1> Chapter 14 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* New languages can be created
* Should listen to what hackers want to make sure it will get used.
* Needs documentation to show how it works.
* Must be free.
* Brevity.
* Let hackers get all up inside it.
* Give it time to percolate and marinate into something people will find delicious.
* Iterate.  Make sure to listen to users to improve. 


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> would be curious to see if this is used as an inspiration piece for people who create languages already. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> Does it hold water?  Is it possible to create this dream language? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> Not enough knowledge in my aresnal to debate the validity of his argument. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> It takes a long time to get your language off the ground, so be patient and in the lag time make it better by listening to users. </li>





<h1> Chapter 15 </h1>
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. Notes ###
* Don't ask people what they do
* Design has to be good, not new.
* Research has to be new, not good.
* If you're designing something, make sure you're included as the end user of the product, that way you'll know it's going to be good.
* Don't get bored.  Design something that's awesome, not something that you think dummies will be able to tolerate.


### 2. Surprising Factors ###
<li> Comparison of Doctors treating symptoms, rather than treating illness is surprisingly good. </li>

### 3. What's unanswered? ###
<li> What's his dialect called?  Do people use it?  Is it good? </li>

### 4. Objections/Disagreements ###
<li> No, I agree with him about designing something new. </li>

### 5. Key takeaways ###
<li> Stay interested, don't generate crap, be excited by designing something that will ultimately make you (the user) better off. </li>
