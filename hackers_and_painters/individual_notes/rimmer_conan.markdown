* Nerds focus on improving their intellects over maximizing their popularity while "average" kids do the opposite.
* Popularity is more valuable in the teenage world than it is adult world, while intellectual ability is conversely so.
* Modern-day schools are more a kin to day care offices than educational institutions.

## What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences ) 

* The idea that schools are meant more to keep kids busy during the day rather than educate them.  I think that while somewhat exaggerated, the idea has some merit as most of the things learned in school prior to college is not used as building blocks for later learning & not used ever again (i.e., not practical).

## What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

* The author says "Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances."  The author seems to suggest only popular kids form alliances & that nerds tend to be unpopular.  Do nerds tend to form alliances as well?  If so, does that increase their popularity?

## Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences) 

* The idea that schools are prisons for teenagers seemed like a stretch.  The analogy seems somewhat apt, as much of high school seemed like busy work to me.  Although, I think this may be unduly harsh; as curricula may have been intentionally watered-down as to not leave any child behind (at the peril of the gifted).

## Takeaways

* Education system should focus more on practical skills above all else to make better use of students' time.

* Hackers and painters are very similar.  They both strive to make beautiful things, sketch at first - fill in later, rework along the way, learn by doing it.
* "Computer science" is not an accurate label for what hackers practice, which is more of an art than a science.
* "Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies." Start-ups succeed by quickly exploiting new and/or underdeveloped markets.
* Open source has been augmented by hackers working on software they love mostly outside of their day jobs (with obvious exceptions).
* One way hackers learn how to develop beautiful software is by examining the source code of great software (learn by example).
* "Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty."
* "The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages."
* "Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one."

## What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences ) 

* The points made regarding the "big company" success strategy compared to that of the start-up.  It reminds me a lot of ecology with pioneering species in new & disrupted ecosystems.  The less-complex, faster-growing species thrive at first & lay the groundwork for the larger, more developed species to come in later.

## What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

* What are attributes of a great hacker?

## Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences) 

* "We can say with some confidence is that these are the glory days of hacking. In most fields the great work is done early on."  While I think for art forms with little practical function this may be true (e.g., art movements, music genres, film genres, etc.), this is not true for hacking, given its products are intended to be functional.  Early hackers build on the work of others, continuously laying another foundation for others to improve upon or disregard. 

## Takeaways

* "Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one."

* The natures of moral fashions seem to be invisible & arbitrary; but violating them "can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed."
* "The Conformist Test" - "do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?" => "there is something wrong with you if you don't think things you don't dare say out loud."
* "The statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true."
* "To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between weakness and power." => "I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to be power struggles in which one side barely has the upper hand. That's where you'll find a group powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them."
* "Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages beyond the thoughts themselves." => "If you can think things so outside the box that they'd make people's hair stand on end, you'll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that people call innovative."
