<h1>Chapter 1: Why Nerds Are Unpopular</h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* chapter discusses the social hierarchy that teenagers create due to the lack of real world affiliation
* nerds are unpopular in high school due to the mass "middle-class" attacking them in order to look more superior

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
It was surprising to hear the analogy between schools and prisons. From the internal society that is created to the "blind eyes" the authority gives, the comparison is not so off base. 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
I would have liked to hear the "recovery" storied and how nerds dealt with acclimating to the real world once they left high school. I also don't think he answered the hierarchy that can happen within a group of similar people

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
No, although I would have liked to see more information about the teachers who did try to fight the education bureaucracy just to prove his points overall. Also, the tone came off as very bitter so it was hard to empathize with him

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* not to take anyone for granted and to listen to all ideas

<h1>Chapter 2: Hackers and Painters</h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* He explains the similarity between artists and hackers in that both require creativity, need time to gain respect, and have similar methods in their creation (sketching, collaborating, being malleable)

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
It was interesting to hear how much he wanted to stay away from the science and math side of things and just focus more on creativity. I always thought that math and programming were similar in thought process but it was interesting to see that coding is not dodo black and white. 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
It seems that creativity is obviously a general concern amongst the hacking community, so I would think that some bigger companies would allow more outlets for creativity to keep great hackers (i.e. LivingSocial). I would have liked to see more research as to what companies are doing now to fix this issue 

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
To go with number 3, I really think companies now should allow for more outlets to be creative (hackathon, etc). 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* "Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one." I think it is easy to forget to take out the user experience when you are just looking for a solution to own problem at first 

<h1>Chapter 3: What You Can't Say </h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* Discussed not getting wrapped up in societal views of what is a right or wrong idea. 
* Recommends taking a look at own views and making sure it isn't influenced by surrounding environment

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
"Think what you want, don't always say what you want." Growing up, we were taught to express our thoughts, but in reality we were only expressing what society wanted us to say. It's important to be dynamic in our thoughts but not sacrifice our time devoted to it by expressing them to people who will think it's crazy 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
There seems to be no real solution on a higher level. It's an endless cycle. For example, society tells is what not to say but we don't rebel and keep putting the same people in power. 

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
Under it all, it seemed a bit paranoid. It's as if he wanted to say don't express all of your ideas because someone might take it instead. The last sentence was the part that rubbed me the wrong way because it was stating that we need to be careful to whom we say our thoughts. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* "Argue with idiots and you become an idiot." I liked that he wanted us to pick our battles and make sure that what we say out loud will be in correlation to the time and effort that will be taken away from other ideas that we wasn't to keep inside. 

<h1>Chapter 4: Good Bad Attitude</h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* Discussed that the idea of breaking into something for the sake of intellectual property is something all hackers should strive for. We shouldn't worry about what can hold us back since it'll prevent innovation

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
I wasn't a fan of the idea that we shouldn't visit other countries due to governments keeping them from being innovative. I think a lot of great ideas come from other countries, but the "American Dream" is what makes us publicize them first. 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
I think he failed to mention the innovations of other countries. If there were truly no innovative ideas from other countries, I would have agreed with his American monopoly on intellectual property 

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
To coincide with question 2, I think we should go to other countries to get an idea of how they think and apply those methods to the way we do things to give us another aspect 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* To not let convention and the status quo from keeping us from trying to push boundaries

<h1>Chapter 5: The Other Road Ahead </h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* Web based software is better than desktop based due to ease for users since all required programs can be sourced from web, ease for programmers since they can use different languages versus the language of the OS, less fear of losing data, easier to release with less bugs, satisfaction of seeing work published more quickly, economically more efficient 

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
Web based software is good because it allows users to debug the software. With desktop software, this was unfathomable but showing these bugs to users and allowing them to catch it would give the developer a better idea of how people are using the program and where the biggest problems lie, allowing them to solve in a faster way 

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
He says web-based applications are the way to go for now, but what does he see as a future past the web?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
Not sure if I agree with not listening to your product managers. I think, overall, yes we have an overall idea of how things would work on the site, but that doesn't meet it will work in the normal day-to-day of the person who is using the application. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* It's better to fix bugs gradually and release versions more often so that it will limit bigger bugs down the road and create less compound bugs
* Build something you love and listen to the two types of customers (less sophisticated shows what to simplify and advanced shows what you need to add). Also, release things quickly at first then improve

<h1>Chapter 6: How to Make Wealth </h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
Top 5% of programmers create 99% of the best code, which is why they are libertarians for the most part. This makes it more clear for the hungry academy since we re trying to create the 5%

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
* what happens when the startup doesn't get bought out but is still a thriving business (LivingSocial)? How do you keep that momentum going when the number of people grows

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
Luck plays a part in the success of oneself (in terms of billionaire status) I only disagree because this is giving the outliers of the rich spectrum

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
The idea of being in "relative poverty" was interesting. On our society today, I think most of us are then in poverty since we are not creating wealth but working for someone who does

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
For those who are wealthy, what drives them to be even more wealthier through stealing and corruption?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
I agree with his reasoning, but not sure if I like the fact that we need to keep "feeding the rich" in order for them to make our lives easier by creating a "tractor for a horse."

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* Wealth comes from what someone creates, but more importantly, it comes from what society views as important to their ecosystem

I liked how he looked at emails as a while and not try to pick out one word for one piece of email. It limits the amount of false positives

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
If we can get rid of spa,mets through email, there would have to be a new way of spamming (for instance it used to be popuos). What new method does he think would come next?

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* Programming can be beautiful due to simplicity, timelessness (being best solution for a while), answering correct question, being suggestive (not giving every detail), working hard to get solution, seeming effortless, imitating life (going through process), through redesign (able to repeat something that you didn't think you could so that you could get other things better), using other people's solution if it's applicable and better, being strange and yourself, working in collaborative groups, and by being daring

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
When creating something, make it beautiful by appealing to the people of the past and future. Don't worry about just the present (I think a lot of people have tunnel vision)

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
I wasn't sure what he meant design needs to be funny as applied to programming. 

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
For open source, how do you find the line between keeping property but still being able to post source code and get peer feedback? Also, what are the cons of static versus dynamic typing?

I liked the idea that wasting the programmer's time is the true inefficiency.  

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )


4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
I understand that he wants to stay near the "main branch" of a tree to predict what would be the language of the future, but later on, he states that we should create a language that would be efficient for the programmer, so I feel like he's just being hyprocritical.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* If ever creating a language, always look ahead versus hat works for you now

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )
This is more regard to us, but if he believes LISP is the best language, why not use that over rails?

4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
I'm not sure I agree with a language being the best. If that were so, why not write books in the original language and have us know the language to appreciate the novels. 

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets)
Always do what language you are comfortable in but make sure it is something ahead of the pack

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
I liked how he thinks a good language is based on the logic of math and not on the ability  of what is good for function at the time.  It seems to me that a good language is forward thinking and not a reactionary thing.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )


4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
* I feel like he's biased towards lisp.  He hasn't really given a positive view on other languages and hasn't also given a negative view of lisp, so it doesn't come off as authentic for the value of lisp over other languages.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets)
* The simpler the language, the better it is versus other languages.

<h1>Chapter 14: The Dream Language </h1>

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* He discusses what makes the ultimate language for programmers (popularity amongst hackers -- not amongst VCs, simplicity -- programmers are "lazy", its ability to be changed quickly and to be used on throwaway programs, the availalbity of libraries)

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
Overall, what hackers think is a good program drives that language to popularity.  I only found this to be surprising because it ends up being a catch 22: what's popular amongst programmers might not be popular with VCs who are the ones who will be funding)

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )

1) Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )
* He basically states that research is using data to create something for a user while design is putting the user first and then working around it to make it better and get better data

2) What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )
The idea that "Worse is better" was an interesting concept because growing up, we are always used to submitting a project with all aspects covered, but in programming, it seems to be the opposite and that we need to get something out quickly and and refine along the way.

3) What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )


4) Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)
I didn't really liek the idea that we should create programs for users based on what they need and not what they want.  I think in the long run, it's better to be proactive and try to give users what they want so that they will stay active with the program.

5) What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )
* Always have working code so that it keeps morale and motivation up
