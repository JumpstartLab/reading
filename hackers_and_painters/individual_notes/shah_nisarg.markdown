# Hackers and Painters Summary
### - Nisarg Shah

## Chapter 1 - Why Nerds Are Unpopular

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Nerds aren’t popular because they have other passions in life - they are less interested in being popular then being smart.
- School is a strange artificial place that doesn’t resemble real-life & is just a holding place. 
- Kids aren’t inherently unhappy monsters. 

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The author compares schools to prisons in that they both serve a similar purpose. Kids in school are just there so the parents can be left alone to do work and prisoners are in prison just to keep them away from our society. Both of these structures breed similar kids of environments with bullying. 

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What should be done about this situation - there are no suggestions? Author says that parents are too busy to fix the entire education bureaucracy. 

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I personally feel he is being too critical of the education system. While it is possible to have apprentices, it restricts them to one possible field. Its unpractical for everyone to have kids at work. 

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

School is an abstract and inaccurate construct that doesn’t resemble real-life
Nerds are living in a more realistic world then the rest of the students

## Chapter 2

- Hackers & Painters are the most similar because they both enjoy building good things.
- Computer science is an inaccurate term because it encompasses too many varied fields (theoretical mathematicians to programmers). This causes people to pursue very abstract &  theoretical ideas which makes them unhappy. 
- Programming languages have to be malleable & flexible

I liked how the author discussed about programming languages. The language needs to be very flexible because its nearly impossible to think of everything before-hand. 

Which languages would the author consider flexible? What makes them flexible enough to use? 

## Chapter 3

- Always question what we cant say. Don’t always speak your mind though - always speaking leads to arguments with everyone and thus wastes time.

## Chapter 4

- Hackers hate excessive control (like aggressive copyright laws) because it restricts innovation & intellectual freedom. (How can we develop new technology if we cannot study the current technology?)
- Hacking has two meanings - 1) ugly code 2) Something so clever that it somehow beat the system.

## Chapter 5

- Web applications are portable & easy to use - there is nothing to install. 
- Web apps are a collection of different programs then one single binary like a desktop application
- Desktop apps are slow in updating because all the fixes need to be released at once (perhaps once a year or so). Web apps are much easier to maintain since fixes can be pushed as soon as possible. This causes fewer bugs, faster new features + more morale since fixes & features happen asap.
- Customer support isn’t a chore - look at this as positive criticism.
- Analyze users to see what they do. 

## Chapter 6

- In startup, you work extremely hard but for several years as opposed to not working very hard for the rest of your life.
- Aim for millions of dollars - not billions. Making billions involves a lot of luck no matter how hard you work, it may still not be achievable without luck. 
- Wealth =/= Money. Wealth is stuff we want like food, clothes, etc. Money is a way of moving wealth. 
- There is no fixed amount of wealth - if you clean up your car + fix it up, you have more wealth but nothing else has changed. 
- Job is an institution similar to college but you get paid instead.
- In software development, it is very hard to accurately judge how hard you work. Companies are not setup to reward a programmer’s hard work since there is no accurate measure of it. 
- The smaller the group = the easier it is to measure their performance. This causes people to do less work in large organizations since it can be easily overlooked. 
- Best way to protect your technology is to make it really difficult for your competitors to replicate. 
- Getting users for startup is incredibly important - everything else comes in second. Cater your application to what the user’s want. 

## Chapter 7

- Technology decreases the gap between the rich and poor. (both rich & poor travel in cars + have the same things available to them). Tech cheapens things except for brand. 
- Even tough technology may increase the variation in income - overall its effects are positive. The poorer people still are much better off then rich people 100 years ago. 
- Technology creates improvement in society that makes life easier.

## Chapter 8

- Spam is a problem that can be solved. If you hired someone to remove spam from inbox - they would easily be able to pick out what is spam. So tech should be able to also.
- Bayesian filter works the best. It works by analyzing all the words and looks at the probability of each words + group of words to be spam. For example, “click” have a very high chance of being spam. 
- Forces spammers to change words which in-turn makes it harder to type their message. 

## Chapter 9

- Good design is simple. The smaller the proof in math, the more elegant it is. Same applies to design. A cleaner interface is more elegant then a crowded one. 
- Good design solves the proper problem. The purpose of the design is to solve some problem - four burner dials. 
- Designing properly is very hard. It requires thought into the problem that needs to be solved. It addresses the problem directly instead of covering around it. 
- Often good design revolves around nature (symmetric, etc)

## Chapter 10

- Machine language is the most basic language which directly talks to the computer
- Assembly is the next level up which is one-to-one conversion with machine lang. 
- Higher Level langs abstract the lower level details to provide a cleaner & easier interface
- The higher level the language -> the more abstract it is.
- Object Oriented programming is going nowhere since companies use it to divide the work

## Chapter 11

- Java will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end like Cobol. 
- Languages are not technology - they are notions. They evolve far less slowly then technology. 
- As computers get more powerful, more varied languages will come. The trade off for more user friendly languages is speed - but with faster computers, this becomes less of a problem. 
- Future languages can be designed today

## Chapter 12

- Don’t be afraid to go against the industry norm.  Viaweb went against the norm and used lisp. This allowed them to keep up with competitors and add new features far quicker then others. 
- Lisp is the best language in the world
- Most big companies want to use “industry standard” because its easier for middle manager.

## Chapter 13

- All languages are not equivalent. We use different languages from the 10 years back because current languages are better. The reason people do is because it makes it easier to pick which one to use.
- Lisp was good because 1) it had conditionals 2) function type 3) recursion 4) dynamic typing 5) garbage collection etc..
- The more demanding the program, the more leverage you get of using a particular language. 
- Two problems - 1) fewer libs, not really an issue 2) finding developers, you need less developers with a better language. 
- Stronger the language -> the less lines of code are needed. 

## Chapter 14

- Expert hackers can tell the difference between good languages but most programmers cannot. 
- Initial critical mass + time decides how popular a programming language is going to be. 
- Programming lang needs a book to become popular + as well as online doc.
- Hackers prefer succinctness. The languages need to be simple but also hackable. They should not be rigid.- Recent language should be quick to write so that throw away programs are possible (ex/ Python > Java)
- Good language needs to be decent fast + stable. 

## Chapter 15

- Design (not new, good), Research (new, bad)
- Designing something for a group is less sophisticated then designing something for you. 
- Design is all about the people.
