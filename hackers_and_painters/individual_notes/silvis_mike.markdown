# Why Nerds are Unpopular
	1.	This chapter is about how Paul feels that the reason nerds are unpopular through grade school is because they don't try to be popular. They are more focused on their intellectual ability then what other people think about them.
	2.	Paul's reflection on grade school. It surprised me how stereotypical Paul's school was. Maybe my school was different but we didn't have different ranks of popularity across tables with jocks and cheerleaders. 
	3.	If Paul went back to grade school would he change anything about what he did and would he try to make himself popular?
	4.	This chapter almost sounded whiney and that Paul was trying to justify himself in high school. 
	5.	The key take away from the chapter is that you can only do so many things in a day. You have to choose what matters most to you and from there focus on that.

# Hackers and Painters
	1.	This chapter discusses the similarities between hackers and painters. Paul theorizes that hackers or programmers are more like painters then mathematical people.
	2.	The line drawn between hackers and painters makes me think that there can a line drawn between hacking and anything. Chad often refers to hackers as musicians, which makes me think that more typically programming is becoming an art form.
	3.	If you have to write an algorithm for a math based problem is this still considered painting?
	4.	Just that if you stretch hard enough hacking can relate to anything. Like Chad says hackers are like musicians in composing.
	5.	That while programming you have to remember to just put an outline down and fill in the details and fix things later. Nothing is permanent.

# What You Can't Say
	1.	This chapter is really about Paul analyzing society and trying to discover why people aren't allowed to say certain things. He analyzes the norms and tries to make his own valid opinion about them.
	2.	f
	3.	What would happen if you were to become one of the norms. Is this proposed idea supposed to help an individual be ahead of the curve?
	4.	I agree. I think in order to think differently you have to be able to see the societal way and be able to work around it.
	5.	Don't always follow, but try to lead and react to what people are doing around you.

# Good Bad Attitude
	1.	Hackers hack simply to hack. They like the idea or challenge of someone telling them they can't do something and this is what drives them to build this ability.
	2.	The biggest thing that stood out to me is that hackers just like to cause mayhem. If you look at Lulzsec they hack for the most part simply to just hack.
	3.	What would it take for hackers to simply stop creating DDOS attacks and taking down organizations.
	4.	I agree to an extent. The part about our founders being hackers of their day is a little shifty in that they had a lot more then 20 people behind them and there cause was more just.
	5.	Hackers aren't people with clear cut motives. They are hacking simply to hack sometimes

# The Other Road Ahead
	1.	That web based software is the way the world should move
	2.	This chapter really seems to make the book seem dated. Paul talks about 20,000 users and how applications NEED to be transferred to the internet when really they already are. I
	3.	When the F was this book written? It's so dated at this point.
	4.	No he pretty much predicted the future...
	5.	Why was Bill pictured on page 86 without any mention of why he was arrested? Seemed very awkward. The only relevant thing still in this chapter is that small software companies can sometimes move much faster then say Microsoft can because you don't need to worry about all of the licensing agreements.

# How to Make Wealth
	1.	All a startup means is that I want to work faster and harder then i ever have before in my life and complete 3 - 4 years of work in a about a month.
	2.	That the most valuable thing of an application is the users that have signed up for it.
	3.	How do you get users to sign up for your site and what are potential revenue streams for them
	4.	Even if you work as hard as possible I believe it may not always turn into results especially with a start up. Also building a company to sell is a personal opinion that I disagree with as I would prefer to hold onto my baby.
	5.	Work Work Work

# Mind The Gap
	1.	People are paid so much because they really are that much better at what they do then everyone else. Because of the gap people push themselves harder and harder then ever before.
	2.	How Paul is not talking about the trickle down effect, but the fact that with technology it will eventually allow everyone even the poor to live a much better life style.
	3.	?
	4.	I agree in a sense. It's interesting to look at wealth from a non trickle down but a "Steve Jobs can do more then 100x other people can" therefore he should get paid that much more. He was an irreplaceable asset to the company.
	5.	"I you let Henry Ford get rich he'll make you a tractor to replace your horse" thus making your life better.

# A Plan For Spam
	1.	Paul discusses ways that we can prevent spam from ever making it to our inbox
	2.	How spammers make such a large business off of this model of 15 people per 1 million emails sent. The spammers spend such little time developing the emails and sending them yet the receiving email spends a second per million people and we have a lot of time wasted from a single spam email.
	3.	How does Google and other large companies actually handle spam filtering now?
	4.	No I agree. Spam filtering is very important. 
	5.	That in 2003 people had to worry about this thing called "spam"

# Taste For Makers
	1.	The creation of something new is typically from the recreation of something we have found to be ugly. 
	2.	That our taste buds truly evolve over time and we can create something that we once thought was beautiful and now a day, month, year later we find it hideous.
	3.	How do you physically go about creating something will be beautiful today, 1000 years ago and 1000 years in the future? Paul discusses how Leonardo did this but what about his paintings made this a reality?
	4.	I agree, every time I go to design something I look at the past and recreate from it.
	5.	Recreation of an object is not copying, it is how everything is done.

# Programming Languages Explained
	1.	Programming languages are a form of code built on top of assembly that allow you to write a much simpler piece of code and have your secretary translate it into something they can understand
	2.	Choosing a language should be about what you are trying to achieve however most programmers don't like to leave their language of choice.
	3.	Why wasn't Ruby included in the chapter?
	4.	Yes. Ruby is the best language ever and Paul skipped over it and failed to mention the language entirely.
	5.	Thank God for my compiler that translates everything I write into useable code.

# The Hundred-Year Language
	1.	Paul believes that it is possible today to write a language that will work for one hundred years from now.
	2.	The fact that Paul says hackers are now putting together these languages that people are now using. But who used to put write the language?
	3.	If there was a language that worked one hundred years from now, what would it be?
	4.	I think it is impossible to write a language for one hundred years from now. If you look at Rails it has very predetermined things it is to accomplish. However what if 100 years from now those things are very different then from today?
	5.	Try to write your application such that they work as in far into the future as possible.

# Beating the Averages
	1.	If you are okay with hitting the average of say growing your company 10% a year then you were doomed to go out of business. You should always be ahead of the average.
	2.	I have never heard of LISP before. But it is true, with more powerful software technologies it is much easier to out pace your competition with features
	3.	Does Yahoo Stores still run on LISP? Or have they since converted
	4.	I agree. Picking your tool sets before starting a project is extremely important in the rate of success your project is going to have.
	5.	Look at job descriptions for your competitors and you can slowly figure out where they are taking the company next.
# Revenge of the Nerds
	1.	Use the most common language that will help get your product built and your users will love as fast as possible.
	2.	How your boss is going to tell you to program in language x when really that is just because it is the most popular and what he knows of.
	3.	How do you realistically determine what language you should program in with all of the varieties?
	4.	His statement about how much "shorter" ruby and Lisp are versus other languages is a little skewed.. It tended to look like he tried to make his examples shorter and more concrete then what it actually should have been.
	5.	Choose your language you are going to use before starting the application because the given language is the best at doing what you are trying to accomplish.

# The Dream Language
	1.	Libraries, efficiency, & time all add together to allow a programmer to focus on solely building the application they want to build and not worrying about the language underneath. They should spend no time programming things that could be used for another application and only what is specific to their current application.
	2.	It makes sense to me that I shouldn't have to constantly rebuild the wheel. If you like at Rails a lot of things like authentication, forms, and the most basic parts of the language are either pre-written or have been done before with easy to find and use gems.
	3.	What is the best way to choose what language is complete?
	4.	I agree completely, and this is why I have fallen in love with Ruby. The pure amount of gems is astonishing and can help you achieve anything in seconds.
	5.	"A programming language does need a good implementation of course, and this must be free. Companies will pay but hackers will not, and this is who you need to attract.

# Design and Research
	1.	Build rapid applications as fast as possible with the user in mind. Don't worry about if it is the prettiest or best code in round one just get something out the door.
	2.	The thing that stood out to me the most was the fact that Paul believe Hail marry passes do not work in building software applications. I agree with him in this and have actually gone through a similar circumstance while building an application of my own.
	3.	What is the appropriate amount of time to build an application before releasing it to the public?
	4.	I agree with the concept that always building and having a working prototype is crucial to staying motivated with the application.
	5.	Build fast and don't ever stop building.
