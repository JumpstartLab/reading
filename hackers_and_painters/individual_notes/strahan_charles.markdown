# Chapter 1

## Summary
* The nerds aren't popular because they have better things to do than play the popularity game.
* Normal kids mistreat nerds as a method of validating their own position within the social hierarchy.
* Schools degenerate into popularity contests because the kids aren't given any *real* purpose. Instead of being measured by a skill, they measure each other by their conformance to arbitrary social constructs.
* Kids that get into drugs aren't necessarily looking for an escape: kids will use drugs as a means of creating their own community.

## Interesting Idea
The last bullet point above. I hadn't considered that before; I always figured kids got into drugs for either the escape or just for the fun of it.

## Unanswered Question
None that I can think of.

## Objections/Disagreements
I can't think of any; from my own experience, this is pretty spot-on.

## Key Take Aways
* Schools, in the state they are now, suck.
* If we gave kids genuine purpose (or at least the freedom to establish their own), they wouldn't have the time to construct (and compete in) popularity contests; instead, they would be measured by how well they achieved success in the real world... which has little in common with life as a student (they don't work, have few responsibilities, etc).

# Chapter 2

## Summary
* Knowing hardcore computer science isn't requisite for crafting software for human beings.
* Hacking isn't a formulaic process, where as math and the other sciences are. Hacking is an inherently creative process, although typically expounding on the prior work of others.
* Programming is an iterative process, and specifications can (and will) change often. Therefore, a good language is one that is malleable. An artist will often use a pencil for a quick sketches - the same cannot be said of sharpies.
* **"A programming language is for thinking of programs, not
for expressing programs youâ€™ve already thought of."**
* A creative person naturally practices their craft because they enjoy what they do. Given that hacking is a creative effort, one should expect that a hacker should be cutting code in their free time, just as a saxophonist will often play in his band after work.
* Creators learn from studying the works of masters. A hacker can learn from reading source code.
* Software is intended for people, so an effective hacker should posses empathy.
* Also, have empathy for those that must read your code.
* **"Programs should be written for people to read, and only
incidentally for machines to execute."**

## Interesting Idea
I don't feel there's anything particularly original in here...

## Unanswered Question
None.

## Objections/Disagreements
None.

## Key Take Aways
* Don't use languages that suck.

# Chapter 3

## Summary
* Non-conformant ideas are often dismissed with labels other than "right" or "wrong".
* Taboos that universal are probably more than just taboos.
* If a "significant percentage" of people disagree with the taboos, they are probably just taboos.
* We censor ourselves around children, giving them an inaccurate idea of language.
* Argue with an idiot and you become an idiot.
* Pick your battles.
* Debating what you disagree with in the abstract can prevent being labeled whatever it is you're combating.
* **"Everything is ok except things that aren't."**

## Interesting Idea
The fact that our subconscious mind can pick out things that don't "percolate" up to conscious mind, as in the example of the radioligists eyes momentarily resting on a tumorous growth. This isn't new to me, but amusing none the less.

## Unanswered Question
Define "significant percentage", PG.

## Objections/Disagreements
The use of "significant" is a little weaselly. What is a "significant percentage"? Whatever PG feels is so? I read books to make more informed choices, and to do so I need objective information... not some hand-wavy mush.

Replace "significant percentage" with "enough" and you'll see that the meaning remains unchanged, but it will also become abundantly clear that his statement is irrefutable:

***If enough people want you to jump of a cliff, will you?*** Well, yes, of course I will - given the *presupposition* that ***enough*** people want me to.

## Key Take Aways
* "Moral fashion" is the same shit that leads people to believe that "saturated fat and cholesterol are bad for you", and "grains are good for you".
* Argue with an idiot and you become an idiot.

# Chapter 4

## Summary
* Ugly and immaginative ideas both break rules.
* **"*Computers* are precise and methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh."**

## Interesting Idea
None.

## Unanswered Question
None.

## Objections/Disagreements
None. Fuck rules.

JK.

## Key Take Aways
* Civil liberties are key so good ideas can prevail.


----------
# Chapter 5

## Summary
* Building web software is more like constructing a city, as opposed to a single building.
* Software on the web has multiple benefits:
 * Shorter release cycle.
 * Same version on all clients.
 * You can watch actual users.
* **"A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost of selling expensive things to them."**

## Interesting Idea
New versions of Viaweb were released an average of 5 times a day. It's been about 15 years since the development of Viaweb, and yet today's software shops still deploy once every week or two (if you're lucky)... WTF.

## Unanswered Question
None.

## Objections/Disagreements
None.

## Key Take Aways
* Writing web software rocks.


----------
# Chapter 6

## Summary

* Wealth is what you want, not necessarily money.
* Shoot for making millions, not billions.
* Wealth can be created.
* Being an employee implies having your value averaged with the other employees.
* To get rich, you need measurable value and leverage.
* Technology can be leveraged, because it is globally applicable.
* Your competitors decide how hard you work.
* Number of users matters most durring a potential acquisition.

# Chapter 7

## Summary
* Variations in income is a sign of health in an economy.
* Wealth is created unequally.
* **"To say that a certain kind of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things."** Wich is of course true, and irrelevant. People pay for the things they wont, right or wrong.
* Having rich people around is a good thing: they produce wealth for their community.

# Chapter 11

## Summary
* Language axioms should be few (amen).
* **"The more of a language that you can write in itself, the better."**
* Separate the meaning of a program from the implementation.

## Interesting Idea
None.

## Unanswered Question
None.

## Objections/Disagreements
As much as I hate Java, I'm not sure I'd suggest that Java is an evolutionary dead end... but I suppose that depends on whether or not you'd call Scala a successor.

I also don't think I'd knock OO so hard...

## Key Take Aways
* None.


-----------
# Chapter 12

## Summary
* The language a programmer thinks in has an impact on the thoughts he can have.
* It's hard to change thought patterns and get stuck doing what you've always done.
* A programmer that knows *X* can only assess the power of languages of equal or less value than *X*. To a Java programmer, Lisp will most likely just look "weird."

## Interesting Idea
None.

## Unanswered Question
None.

## Objections/Disagreements
There are some obvious advantages to going with the herd that PG omits: the most expressive language in the world isn't worth using if you don't have the requisite libraries available and a dependable source for support - and there's a pretty strong correlation between such attributes and commercial adoption. One could argue that you could always implement/fix what you need... but what if what you need is a high performance implementation of multivariate linear regression? Most people would be SOL, unless they just so happened to take an AI class...

## Key Take Aways
* Know a ton of languages, and pick the one that you find most productive.


-----------
# Chapter 13

## Summary
* Not all languages are created equal. (OK, OK, I get it, PG)
* Programming languages are just now catching up to Lisp.
* Pointy haired bosses will want to follow the herd, because that makes it easy for them to avoid blame for poor results. This results in shitty languages being used in corporate environments.
