###Chapter 1 - Why Nerds are Unpopular
* Summary
  * The real world is very different from school as a kid, and it can be tough for those who prioritize things desired by the productive real world as opposed to popularity.
* Stood Out
  * I was surprised at the idea that schools are merely a place for parents to drop their kids to stay busy while they do work. I would think that the system would either be smarter than that or people would remove themselves from it in larger percentages if that is the case. Unless everyone is oblivious to this "truth".
* Question Unanswered
  * Although he partially answered how to handle this system as a nerd to make it not as bad, he did not answer a better solution for training people to perform the jobs of today's specialized world. Also he did not answer how to handle being a part of multiple worlds such as being an athlete and a nerd as I was and I'm sure many are.
* Objections
  * I somewhat disagree that playing by all of the rules and shutting your mouth is constantly pushed. Maybe I had different teachers but they seemed to encourage me to think outside of constraints, create change, and stand up for what I believe within the constraints of respect and reason.
  * I also disagree with the premise that all humans are happy working. Some seem to be more content doing nothing.
* Takeaways
  * I want to remember that the reason why people in high school (and I'm finding in the real world) can be so different isn't always based on their inherent abilities, but rather what they prioritize.

###Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters
* Summary
  * People who code/hack are more makers than scientists. There is an art to it and we are in the golden age of exploration.
* Stood out
  * studying other makers is more useful than studying computer science theory. I would think that you have to understand the building blocks fully to be able to implement elegant solutions, but he claims that you only need a certain amount of knowledge of how to use and not necessarily how it all works. This is very contradictory to my computer architecture courses.
* Question Unanswered
  * what differentiates people who become different types of makers and what can each learn from each other aside from making something malleable.
* Objections
  * Beautifully created things aren't always in areas no one wants to explore, sometimes they're in areas no one has yet been able to figure out how to explore properly.
  * Good research is not based on faulty premises even if that allows for a longer explanation.
* Takeaways
  * do work or work for businesses that allow me flexibility to create and solve problems, not just engineer the vision of others
  * start doing some open source work for fun and learning
  * save easy tasks for times when I'm not excited by other work

###Chapter 3 - What you can't say
* Summary
  * most things that are taboo are enforced by those in some power but that feel threatened by the possibility of losing that power. People who are afraid of standing out go along, and these taboos get passed down to children before they have their own experiences.
* Stood out
  * statements that make people the maddest are ones they are worried might be true. Totally makes sense. That's why people have pet peeves for things that they don't like about themselves or dont want to have. I never thought of it this way before, but it's protective as a human. It's threatening and you have to get rid of it so you get angry, the fight response.
* Question Unanswered
  * in psychology we learned that when you say things out loud then in order to decrease cognitive dissonance you start to believe that you feel that way. How do you avoid against that with moral fashions if you are holding what can't be said inside your head only?
* Objections
  * just because something is considered harmless in more cultures than not does not mean that it is not actually bad. That line of thinking is contradictory with his premise that there are times when the majority believes something bad is not bad, e.g. Slavery.
* Takeaways
  * to do great work you need a brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to go. I like the idea of encouraging outside the box thinking even if it's taboo.
  * encourage outrageous thoughts in the head but don't waste time arguing silky things with idiots

###Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude
* Summary
  * what makes hackers and America great is the ability to be slightly rebellious, break rules, and then create something better.
* Stood out
  * the idea that the founding fathers were more like hackers in that they encouraged regulations (government) to constantly be challenged. That rebellious nature is what this country was founded upon and somehow that is now taboo in the eyes of people and what is "American" as defined by politicians is completely different.
* Question Unanswered
  * where do you draw the line? You can't be constantly disagreeing and get along/get things done.
  * if America is becoming totalitarian, where should hackers go?
* Objections
  * he claims basically that any restriction promotes not as good ideas. I'm  not sure that's the case. If you restrict some of what people are working on then we are not going in every which direction, we can have a more defined goal to work towards.
* Takeaways
  * challenge what is taken for granted. It is that mindset that allows you to break through boundaries and create something great.

###Chapter 5 - The other road ahead
* Summary
  * web software is awesome because it allows you the flexibility to be cross-platform, iterate quickly, build inexpensively, and further separate users from needing to know more about how a computer works.
* Stood out
  * piracy is good because it takes people who would never buy the software and makes them users who might buy it later. Interesting take to accept fewer people could pay in the short term for potentially more users in the long term, but potentially the same amount of users in the long term. Have to think about this more as to whether it's actually a good idea.
* Question Unanswered
  * what is the best method of gaining adoption to your software. Sure it has to be useful, but not all useful software gets adopted.
* Objections
  * I am not sure if web based applications are entirely the answer. Many times they can underperform due to either the speed of the users Internet connection or their level of comfortability with the web. I think there are certain programs that must stay as software unfortunately for those reasons.
* Takeaways
  * don't be afraid to start a business because you don't know about business or because of competition. Those are currently as electrical fences.

###Chapter 6 - how to make wealth
* Summary
	* people work harder in small groups and their rewards are more tied to their performance. startups are a great place to work very hard for a couple of years for the potential of making a lot of money. if you can make things that people want, you can create wealth.
* Stood out
  * the first 5-10 employees are the most important in a startup. Makes sense because that's when you shape the direction of the company and those people hire more like them. Interesting to look at how LivingSocial shaped that way, then shaped differently as we had to rapidly hire.
* Question Unanswered
  * if startups are a way to get rich quicker, but they fail more often, over the course of an average person's lifetime do they end up working more time by going the startup route or by going the big company route. Yes one is safer and one is riskier, but in aggregate who wins?
* Objections
  * if you fix an old car and sell it for more you don't expand the pie. There is a fixed amount of money and somewhere down the end of the trail of that money someone has less money for you having gained money. I understand that you may have created extra wealth because you are enabling yourself to enjoy something more by getting money for something you made, but since there is a finite amount of currency you are not creating money.
* Takeaways
  * wealth is what you want out if life, not necessarily money, though it can be a means.
  * vc's pay close attention to barriers to entry in the industry

###Chapter 7 - mind the gap
* Summary
  * societies with high income disparities are economically healthy because that means that some people are being rewarded for generating a lot of worth which is overall good for the inhabitants of the country.
* Stood out
  * worth in terms of what people get paid is what people are willing to spend for their work. it makes sense in theory that people should get paid proportionately to how much worth they bring to the table. i've always heard that if you can do something that few other people can then you will get paid well for it, i guess this fits in line with that.
* Question Unanswered
  * how can a society with high income disparity be healthy if the people at the low end of that disparity can't afford to buy the wealth being sold by the rich manufacturers? Is it the guiding hand or is high income disparity not a sign of a prosperous nation? In todays globalized economy I'm not sure that a few rich people help a country.
* Objections
  * the ceo example does not necessarily make sense in terms of being paid fairly for worth. there are many cases where a ceo simply gets paid more because he was there first or has worked his way up the ladder and has been asked to head up a new company. there are most likely people who create more worth who are paid less. there are probably many people in government for whom my argument applies as well.
* Takeaways
  * since some companies that makes less expensive products make more money, they can focus on design and actually make better products. That's an interesting thought as to the kind of industry that I would potentially want to go into at some point. You can end up making better products that cost less.


###Chapter 8 - A plan for spam
* Summary
  * a personalized spam filter based off of the content of messages is more affective than anything related to the the sender because it can constantly update and adapt. False positives are bad
* Stood out
  * the mind of the spammer. that spamming is a business and they employ some business practices to try to make users interested in their emails and gain money.
* Question Unanswered
  * how do i implement a bayesian filter?
* Objections
  * if i were to implement a spam filter for myself, i would want some sort of seed so that until i have enough content i wouldn't want to receive every spam email.
* Takeaways
  * personalization tasks seems to be the key. if you want something done right for an individual, you have to make it adaptable to that person, not a one-size fits all model because everyone has different preferences, needs, and interactions.

###Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers
* Summary
  * Design can be practiced and cultivated just like anything else. There is such a thing as good design and bad design, and there are certain principles to follow.
* Stood out
  * Good design is strange. It is interesting that the more people experiment and become experts, the more they find strange things about this world that are true. Design follows in suit. Would be interested to learn more about what kinds of strange features make good design.
* Question Unanswered
  * How good is good enough. I understand that it is important to throw away and start again on designs, but at what point is it enough? Where does 80/20 kick in when trying to scale a business?
* Objections
  * While there are some principles that make some design better, there is still some subjectivity. Some people prefer certain colors, shapes, arrangements, etc. That's why e.g. people design their rooms differently, even if they are professional interior designers.
* Takeaways
  * Simple design is important. The base has to be there, then the flashy stuff doesn't matter. It has to be relevant to multiple eras.

###Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained
* Summary
  * there are many different programming languages that vary in how low-high level they are, as well as how object-oriented and dynamic vs static typing they are.
* Stood out
  * we are in a language renaissance or war, where so many are created all the time. I wonder how people create languages, what they see as missing, and how certain languages win out in popularity over others.
* Question Unanswered
  * what languages are best for what purposes?
* Objections
  * from what I've done and seen I don't see the need for low level languages to speed things up especially since computers are so fast now.
* Takeaways
  * learn lots of languages and keep pushing the envelope because everything is changing rapidly. Also don't be afraid of learning a new language since they can have similarities.

###Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language
* Summary
  * programming languages will change dramatically in the next 100 years due to the increase in computing power. there will be fewer languages than now since ideas will converge.
* Stood out
  *
* Question Unanswered
  * what languages currently make the most of fast computers and are the quickest for the user to write? how can those be improved further? in what ways hypothetically could someone write languages in such a way that a user would be able to write code and it would make sense like english?
* Objections
  * while getting farther away from the computer is desirable in terms of getting more people to learn to program, it has the potential to have fewer people understanding truly what is happening through all of the levels of interpretation, as long as it works. that could potentially stunt innovation.
* Takeaways
  * keep learning new languages, they will change as computers get more powerful. push the limits

###Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages
* Summary
  * startups either win big or don't make any money. you have to have a technical advantage in order to outpace your competitors
* Stood out
  * how powerful lisp seems to be. i am intrigued to learn it because of how much he seems to be a proponent for it. if nothing else it might even help me with other languages.
* Question Unanswered
  * how do you know at the start of a startup what language to use. if you use a less popular language for a startup that has the potential to get huge, you may have trouble recruiting. but if you use a more popular language you may not iterate as fast.
* Objections
  * similar to my unanswered question. if you use a not-widely-used language that is powerful for a startup and the startup grows, you may find a shortage of talent to acquire to meet the needs of the company.
* Takeaways
  * learn powerful languages and keep learning, don't get stuck in one language because it seems to have everything i might need.

###Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds
* Summary
  * some languages are superior to others, but this is not readily apparent to people who know nothing about computer languages and which are best for which problem, so instead of learning more about languages, they take the easy route and follow the industry standard, which is not usually optimal.
* Stood out
  * it is upsetting and not surprising that pointy-haired bosses only care about not losing their job. they show loss aversion behavior instead of attempting to achieve gains. similar to most things, we are motivated more by fear of loss than by potential gain.
* Question Unanswered
  * What languages are best for what problems? Can they play nicely together to allow for solving problems with the optimal language?
* Objections
  * lisp doesnt seem better than ruby if ruby does the same thing in the same amount of lines (assuming other examples are similar), looks cleaner, and is more widely adopted.
* Takeaways
  * in a startup write software to please the users and the vcs and acquirers will like you. don't worry about what they want in lieu of what is best for users.

###Chapter 14 - The Dream Language
* Summary
  * the best kind of language offers maximum capabilities with libraries and abstractions that allow minimum effort, but where you can still get into the nitty gritty to change things.
* Stood out
  * the way to make the first 20 (most important) hackers aware of a new language is to give them a program that they want written in a new language so that they get to use it. also it must have online documentation and a book
* Question Unanswered
  * following with the theme of the book that lisp is the best language, why is it the best in comparison to its close counterparts?
* Objections
  * rewriting functional code to make it better is not always optimal when you are trying to scale a business. yes it is great, but it might not be necessary when time is of the essence.
* Takeaways
  * big systems start from throwaway (one purpose, quick to write) programs. write those and evolve them to bigger things instead of trying to tackle something huge. rely on libraries.
  * be optimistic about your ability to solve the problem and pessimistic about your current solution.

###Chapter 15
* Summary
  * when you design anything (including a programming language), don't be like research and try to do something different and novel. first priority should be to make it work for the end user and make it something they need.
* Stood out
  * worse is better. get something in front of the end users as quickly as possible to figure out what will work and what won't. keep working on the initial prototype as time and need allows, but always have something that works
* Question Unanswered
  * when implementing radically new and different things into your prototype, i assume at some point things aren't fully working so that you can make room for the big change. what is the best practice there?
* Objections
  * in some cases it is not best to make users aware of what you are doing early because competitors may get an idea of what you are doing and a headstart on catching up. it might be better in some cases when you have experience with what kinds of things users want to keep a product behind closed doors. it worked for apple.
* Takeaways
  * people don't always know what they need, don't be a short-order cook when making a product. try to see what they need from what they are saying they want
