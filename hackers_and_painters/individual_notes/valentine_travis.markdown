# Hackers and Painters Summary
### - Travis Valentine

## Chapter 1 - Why Nerds Are Unpopular

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Paul Graham wasn't popular in high school and he wouldn't have it any other way.
- Popularity isn't nearly as important as being smart.
- Nerds are better than everyone else.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That he seems to almost dismiss the possibility of someone being smart AND popular, because I think that is one of the sterotypes of anyone smart that he continues by practically demeaning popularity.

That, after all the talk about the ills of everything in life, it is in fact possible for things to be better.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why do nerds and popular people need each other in some situations?

Why all of the emphasis on nerds? I understand the logic behind some of the explanations and validations for their behavior, but if he agrees external factors influence everyone shouldn't there be more common ground presented than there actually is among the classes?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think he gives teenagers way too much credit for the work they put into popularity, making me sort of offended to claim they work harder than Navy Seals.

I find it insuffrable when Graham states that "the thought of average intelligence is unbearable". It just doesn't put me in the best frame of mind for the rest of the book.

On the whole, I understand what he was saying. But I think everyone tries to survive/thrive in their environment in different ways. Some are obviously kinder, more productive, and leave society better; but we all try to do our thing given the circumstances.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- A child's youth is a terrible time. For nerds, it's even more so because they aren't challenged and are forced to fit into a system.
- Paul Graham clearly has a set vision of what he considers to be a nerd. And they are better than anyone else.
- Paul Graham was a nerd. Nerds want to be the smartest in the class and spend their time thinking about things that matter, not trivial things like popularity.
- Anything you want should take full focus.
- Doing things that interest you is better than being subject to whatever else the public education system provides.

## Chapter 2 - Hackers and Painters

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Hackers are makers and are best when not confined by a structure imposed by those who don't understand them.
- Hacking takes its cues from other areas of making. 
- Where doing is the best way to learn; there is a relentlessness to creating a great, beautiful product; and collaboration is clear.
- Like other makers before, Hackers find themselves in a defining time period.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That, despite the assertion that Hackers are best without structure, Graham says that structure is the best way to collaborate.

These are the glory days of hacking. I would've considered the early days of computing to be the glory days.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Wouldn't empathy go at odds with what was put forth in Chapter 1, which seemed to be about motivation through a sort of bitter validation?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Not really, this chapter made way more sense to me than the first one.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Bug fixes can be good, but they shouldn't dominate or define a hacking culture.
- Empathy makes a good hacker great.
- Great makers leave a trail for others to build on.
- Great software and great code should make sense and take into account people's points of view.

## Chapter 3 - What You Can't Say

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- What might seem ridiculous now, or get you in trouble for saying, might not be as big of a deal in the future.
- To push boundaries, you need to allow yourself to think big.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Again, despite the clear preference of not containing your thoughts, Graham emphasizes restraint. "Pick your battles."

There is a middle ground that is encouraged: don't hold back everything, think heresy, but only express it to a few people. It makes complete sense but I feel as if it goes against his earlier points.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Argue with idiots and you become an idiot. Well, if everyone is encouraged to be - and think - bold, then who is to label others idiots?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't know if it's much of an objection or disagreement as perhaps an unfinished thought, but being withdrawn and allowing observation to inform one's decisions seems at odds with the typical Hacker mantra.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Thinking well beyond the box helps clarify where people will be able to go. And little by little, as you go outside the box, you are deemed innovative.
- The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not necessarily say it.

***

## Chapter 4 - Good Bad Attitude

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Hacking is a way of life.
- Hackers need access to current technology to help pave the way for future technology.
- Those who break rules are the source of wealth and power in America.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That civil liberties make countries rich. If you believe hackers are the ideal focus group for civil liberties, then they are the most likely to make a country rich. 

That authorities didn't think of the possibility that people could do things out of sheer intellectual curiousity. I never thought how strange it is to think that people might do things just to do them.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Do Hackers make a concerted effort (SOPA aside) to present a rational case that the decisions a Government makes is about competitiveness and the value of good ideas?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't think you can broadly say "hackerliness" seems frowned upon. Sure, hackers don't have the best reputation in some circles but I think it's not so black and white any more. Especially as parts of the hacker mantra seep into other areas.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Be genuine in your disobedience.
- An open society is a better, more effective society.

***

## Chapter 5 - The Other Road Ahead

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Graham goes through his lessons with Viaweb and reflects on the advantages he had over his competitors.
- The web wins over the desktop on almost every front.
- Startups benefit from the advances in web development.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That big companies fear small startups. I find this tough to believe because, although I get it conceptually, I sometimes assume big companies can be agile.

That web design is purposefully designed to be rapid.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does design factor into the structure of a startup? Today it seems design is just as integral in a startup.

If a web page has to be just good enough, who is to determine whether it is or isn't? And how do they determine that?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The nature of web development is to create things to take the heavy lifting off of a hacker so they can focus. So not every programmer today needs to be a system administrator, unlike they did years ago.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Good software is convenient and not stressful.
- Web-based development wins over desktop development.
- Smaller teams are better.

## Chapter 6 - How to Make Wealth

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Creating wealth is what you want to do.
- To create wealth, do something people want. And do it fast.

**2. What was one idea that surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That if you look at it at a high-level, work should be framed as doing something another person wants. By making others happy you find a better path to success. This makes sense, I've just never heard it framed that way.

Group sizes are tied to average ability. So a larger group opens itself to the chance of being average on the whole. I just never thought of the dynamics of a group much before.

At every decision point, choose the harder path because it allows you to provide a buffer between the competition. I thought you'd want to do what was easiest given the available resources.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Does it go beyond just making something people want? Does it mean more if a few people just love your product as opposed to more that want it? Which is better? Is there a difference?

What happens when a group is entirely made up of great talent? How do you maintain it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

The most valuable aspect of a company in an acquisition is the number of its users. I think that's true in some cases, but often you see value in the product early on or perhaps the team. Acquisitions aren't just for users any more, it seems.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- There isn't a fixed pie. You can create more wealth.
- Large groups make one person's value more difficult to measure.
- Allowing people to make money and keep it leads to a more productive, better society.

***

## Chapter 7 - Mind the Gap

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Technology decreases the gap between rich and poor.
- Allowing those who created wealth to keep it is important.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Technology has helped weed out corruption by shifting how wealth is attained, because it helped change the perception of how people obtain wealth.

The value of wealth creation isn't the resulting jobs, but the fringe benefits of the productivity that led to that wealth. The output makes our lives richer.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In an earlier chapter Graham said many hackers are libertarians. Why do the more famous technologists then seem more inclined to a fair tax system that benefits others as well?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I get the point about allowing those who create wealth to keep it, but it seems like most wealthy people past a certain point just stop caring about money. (As long as they can keep some of it.)

By emphasizing the product created by the pursuit of wealth (the example used was the car), you take away from the benefit to society of job creation. I think both of those lead to a better society, so you can't discount the job creation.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- If there is enough demand for something, technology will meet it. And the end result will at least be more convenient than a more expensive option.

***

## Chapter 8 - A Plan for Spam

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Bayesian filters will be the most effective at fighting spam.
- Taking a statistical approach is advantageous.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

More laws can help filter spam better. I don't know what surprised me more - the thought of the government intervening and placing restrictions on spammers or Paul Graham being in favor of it.

To beat Bayesian filters, spammers would have to make their mails indestinguishable from ordinary mail. This effectively would constrain them, which proves the effectiveness of statistical filtering.

Sentence 2

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Won't spam extend past just email? There are so many other mediums on which we communicate. Can't spam just go there?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Not really, as I don't know much about statistical filtering or spam.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Constraining spammers will make filtering easier.
- The more spam filters there are, the harder it will be to get through them.

***

## Chapter 9 - Taste for Makers

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Taste isn't relative. There is good taste and bad.
- Good design is much more diffcult to achieve than it seems.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

You can't really force individuality because you naturally find your style by doing things your way.

Working from life isn't just to make a replica. It's to give you something to create.

Design should look easy. If it does, it is likely to be simple. But that means everything was done right, which is hard to achieve.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What are the best ways to evolve one's taste? How do you learn to appreciate great design, particularly if it's simple which can sometimes be easy to overlook.

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't necessarily know that community is as physically important as it was in, say Leonardo's time. Sure communities still exist but they are online. So physical location seems less important. And you can participate passively in a community to help improve your taste.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Suggesting is more engaging than telling.
- Cultivate dissatisfaction.
- Aim for timelessness.
- Don't be afraid to make something pre-existing better.

## Chapter 10 - Programming Languages Explained

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- There are many different types of languages.
- Higher-level languages are better to program in.
- Bullet 3

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

I never knew there was source code and object code. After learning what object code is, it makes sense as to why Windows has made a ton of money.

I didn't know that Java prevented the programmer from doing "dumb stuff", nor did I know most operating systems were written in C. Though that makes sense as to why Java and C are so widely taught.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In terms of open source and more closed systems, what is the true benefit of open source given the success of the iPhone for example?

What's the benefit of creating another language? I get that some just don't do what is needed, but is it better to have 500 languages than say 100?

Why wouldn't someone want to learn/know at least two languages?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Along the lines of my question, while I get the benefit of having numerous languages when is too many overwhelming?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Machine language is everything a computer can do.
- Assembly languages allow for friendlier names.
- Compilers turn high-level language into something the hardware can understand.
- Interpreters are an alternative to compilers.
- Source code is readable. Object code isn't. Well, it's just tougher.
- Dynamic typing allows you to define a variable whenever.
- Static typing is set, preventing bugs and generating code faster.

## Chapter 11 - The Hundred-Year Language

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- It's hard to say what language we'll be programming in a hundred years from now, but odds are it'll make programming even easier.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

That the notion of strings, integers, arrays, etc. could be gone (or vastly different) in a hundred years. I'm just starting to learn about these, so to think they'll be gone is strange.

Parallelism won't be as pervasive. This surprises me mainly because I can't imagine computers doing anything other than multiple things at once.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Why are the languages of today separated from what could potentially be the language in a hundred years? Why are they presented as essentially mutually exclusive?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I don't really know enough to object.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- The languages of the future will be written by doers, not researchers.
- As machines get faster and better, the key is to reduce inefficiency for programmers not the machines they work on.
- Graham sees object-oriented programming as unbeneficial for good programmers, but essential to large organizations.

## Chapter 12 - Beating the Averages

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Picking the technology that's right for you is important and shows you know what you're doing.
- Lisp can do things other languages can't.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

How central Lisp is to this chapter of the book. I didn't expect this to be such a theme.

You can tell if hackers or hacker culture is engrained in the company by reading job descriptions.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

Is it really the language that sets a company apart or the companies use and implementation of that language? See Facebook with PHP, etc.

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

If a language is to be what works best for the hacker, then judging the company off of the language seems less like saying hacker culture doesn't pervade the company as much as the company just makes bad technology decisions.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Your technology stack can set you apart from competitors.
- Read job descriptions of other startups if you want to learn what they are working with.

## Chapter 13 - Revenge of the Nerds

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Industry best practice often gets you the average, not the best technology stack.
- Some of the more popular languages today have roots similar to Lisp.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Ruby (and even Python) are similar to Lisp.

Base your technology on what makes the most sense to the users, nobody else, because they are the ones that matter. I would've thought you base your technology on what your company knows best.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

If Lisp is such a great language on top of which other popular ones are based, what does the future hold for it?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

No, not really.

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- The more demanding an application, the more powerful language you should use.
- The more powerful the language the shorter the program.
- I'm pretty happy to be learning Ruby.

***

## Chapter 14 - The Dream Language

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- A program should be both cleanly designed yet flexible.
- Libraries will be given the same amount of detail as the core language.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

Efficiency hasn't mattered much in end-user applications. This is surprising because I feel like we often develop for a least common denominator.

You can be building a language without really knowing it since languages don't start big.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

In a language, isn't there a barrier to understanding where things have been made easier for the programmer?

Can open source create the dream language?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

Organic growth is better, but yet we focus on who gets VC funding, etc.

Open source will lead to the dream language, yet isn't the open source community sort of like a committee?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- Programming languages are good only if hackers like them.
- To become popular a programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular system.
- For a language to be used by big systems it must work for throwaway programs.

***

## Chapter 15 - Design and Research

**1. Summarize the chapter ( 1+ bullets )**

- Design doesn't have to be new but it has to be good. Research has to be new but it doesn't have to be good.
- Design and research eventually converge at the user.

**2. What was one idea the surprised or stood out to you? Why? ( 2-4 sentences )**

The customer is right in that design should work for the user, but the user doesn't have to explicitly say what it is they want. It is our job to understand that.

Morale is key to design because you have to feel inspired and be inspired to do inspired work.

**3. What was a question that you saw as unanswered? ( 1-2 sentences )**

What about the users who don't see much utility in the product? How do you factor them into the equation? Just brush them off?

**4. Did you have any objections or disagreements? ( 1-2 sentences)**

I think it's important to understand how a product gets off the ground. For example, I'd be interested to know what functionality would be enough to hook a user group. In some cases I guess one set of functionality is enough but is that the same in others?

**5. What were your key take aways or things you want to remember? ( 1+ bullets )**

- An application should be user-centric.
