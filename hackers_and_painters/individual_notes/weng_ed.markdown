Chapter 1: Why Nerds are Unpopular
1) Nerds are unpopular because their focus lies in getting ahead in education vs. getting ahead in a social setting.
2) PG thinks that kids persecute other kids in order to feel better about themselves.  This is surprising because there seem to be alternative ways that are less harmful to others to make oneself feel better (e.g. doing well on your own tests or having your own accomplishments).
3) Towards the end, PG alludes towards the fact that schools aren’t going to change anytime soon.  The question that begs to be asked then is, what is the right balance that can be struck between excelling in a social setting and doing well in school? Surely it can’t be binary.
4) PG thinks that when it comes to a “real external test of skills” that it’s not painful to be at “the bottom of the hierarchy.” This doesn’t seem right...  At university, tons of kids suffered solely because they were at the bottom of their classes.
5) Author seems extremely bitter at the junior highs and high schools of the world.  Don’t be that bitter.


Chapter 2: 
1) Hacking is more similar to art than one might initially think because artists and hackers are both creators.
2) “Instead of entrusting the future of the software to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design.”  This is why startups typically win.
3) Why can’t big companies still win even with some disasters.  Google wave?  Google plus?
4) PG seems to believe that hackers should start original and get good.  This is contrary to some of how I’ve learned how to program.  Many of the books that I use attempt to have readers copy code and then learn some of the fundamentals from this already-good code.  This has worked for me in the past... He then contradicts himself by saying that hackers can copy good work.
5) Understand that being agile gives you a superior advantage against bigger companies.  Additionally, recognize that fighting in an already existing domain (e.g. word processors) puts you at a significant disadvantage.


Chapter 3:
1) Question everything, especially "moral fashions" so that you aren't mistaken, so that you don't miss the ideas that have been overlooked (e.g. natural selection)
2) The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want. And if you feel you have to say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking improper thoughts.
3) Does questioning moral fashion really mean that you are better at thinking outside the box for other things (e.g. startup ideas)?  PG assumes that this connection is true, but I'm not sure it is…
4) "A confident group doesn't need taboos to protect it…  And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a taboo."  Is this true?  PG thinks that it's ok to make disparaging remarks about Americans or the English.  Where is that ok to do?  Foreign countries?  If so, is it ok to make fun of the Chinese?  China is one of the most powerful countries at the present…
5) Continue questioning things. Trusted friends that you can openly discuss taboo issues with are valuable.


Chapter 4:
1) Hackers are disobedient because they know that civil liberties are what make America so great.
2) "Civil liberties make countries rich.  If you made a graph of GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite trend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect?"  This point that PG makes is interesting because it seems true.  America was founded on civil liberties; this was long before the country became powerful and rich.
3) See #4
4) I question whether hackers really have this "sense" of totalitarianism approaching from a distance.  Rather, I believe that hackers simply enjoy mischief and knowing that they can circumvent a system that is in place.  If this weren't the case, then why hack vulnerable sites?  Why steal passwords from the Playstation Network?  PG justifies copywriter, but not blatant criminal hacking.
5) America is a great country because it affords its citizens civil liberties that would be unheard of in other countries.  This is a parallel to Chapter 3 -- continue questioning rules that are in place.  This ultimately leads to good solutions.


Chapter 5:
1) Technology is progressing towards being on a single client (the internet) and this opens a lot of opportunities for small startups to take out larger software giants (e.g. Microsoft) who are afraid of cannibalizing their own business.
2) One idea that I found interesting was that IBM used to be the dominant player in the mainframe space but they lost out to Microsoft when consumers started purchasing desktops because they were too busy convincing people to continue using mainframes.  I think this is interesting especially as we move towards purely web-based software.
3) Why doesn’t Microsoft just invest more time into building better APIs for software developers?  Is it because they already know the trend toward single platform software is here?  Will the next version of Office be purely internet based? What are the benefits of non-web based applications?  Are consumers more willing to pay? What if your user-base is in locations where they cannot connect to the internet?
4) I agree with largely everything PG says in this chapter.
5) By being flexible, low-cost, and easy to start, web startups have been able to vastly change the software space and push things toward the web.


Chapter 6:
1) This chapter is about what wealth actually is, why people want it, and how it relates to the startup business model.
2) When faced with two problems, an easy one and a hard one, pick the hard one that your competitors will have to struggle to complete. Also, for most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain but the fear of loss.
3) “We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal...” Why is there no room for this “safe path”? Is it because this is the route everyone would take?
4) No real complaints in this chapter...
5) Number of users is one of the most, if not the most, important tests.  It is the true sign that you are creating wealth... That you are making something that people want.


Chapter 7:
1) This chapter talks about society’s view on the current model of wealth and some reasons why it might be so negative.
2) PG writes, “Will people create wealth if they can’t get paid for it? Only if it’s fun. People will write operating systems for free. But they won’t install them, or take support calls, or train customers to use them. And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.” Look for difficult problems to solve with high entries to barrier. This is where you have the greatest chance for success.
3) Taxation does not seem to be hampering the innovation in today’s world. Why? Is it not severe enough?
4) PG argues that “expanding the pie” is something the richest countries have learned how to do and that there isn’t much “stealing” going on...  I would argue that the stock market is the biggest example of a zero-sum game there is.  Coincidentally, the stock market is where many of the richest Americans make their money (even VCs).  Am I missing something?
5) There are many ways to look at certain issues.  PG proposes one view saying that the disparity of wealth is a good thing. Don’t forget there are hundreds of other people making the exact opposite argument.


Chapter 8: 
1) This chapter is about spam -- what it is, why people send it, and how we can stop it.
2) Spammers are businessmen and the reason they do it is because it works. I found this statement to be interesting because I have long forgotten why people send out spam. These days, their response rate must be ridiculously low.
3) What other techniques outside of Bayesian filtering work well?
4) Will spammers really just choose not to spam if our filters continue to get better? How do you know it won’t have the opposite effect?  For instance, instead of spamming 1,000,000 people they spam 30,000,000 in hopes of tricking one person?
5) It’s important to consider all kinds of techniques to solve everyday problems.  Bayesian filtering happened to be the technique of choice for PG when it came to the problem of having to read spam, but there’s a lot of facets in our lives where we could afford to use more technology.


Chapter 9:
1) In chapter 8, PG writes about what makes good work.  For a lot of professions, people attribute design to taste, which is actually deeper than just a subjective perspective.
2) “Good design is redesign. It’s rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away some early work. They plan for plans to change.” I often hate redoing work, but I’ve noticed by now that doing something a second time always produces cleaner results.
3) Good design can copy. Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it’s more important to be right than original.  Can you get to being an expert without taking the second step of trying to be original?  Does that influence your personality and style when you finally return to good design?
4) 
5) Before you try an ornate solution, give the simple one a shot first. Some of the best design is simple but it’s often the hardest.  


Chapter 10:
1) This chapter is an overview of programming languages -- what are they and why do they differ from each other?
2) “So it is probably all to the good that programmers live in a post-Babel world. If we were all using the same language, it would probably be the wrong one.” PG implies that choice is a good thing. Because there are so many languages, innovation is left uncapped while still permitting ideas to transfer from language to language. Are we witnessing our own Renaissance in programming.
3) PG suggests that open source software is the best type of software.  What are the advantages of being a big company?  If Microsoft were to open source Windows, how would it make its money?
4) “Some languages are object-oriented in the sense that they let you program in that style, and others in the sense that they force you to. I see little advantage in the latter. Surely a language that lets you do x is at least as good as one that forces you to.” Is this statement really true? Could be advantageous to have code that looks similar across different programmers by the sheer nature that you cannot write it any other way.
5) Don’t let language choice get in the way of coding.  At the core of the language, you can do what you want with almost any language, so just make the choice that feels comfortable with you.


Chapter 11:
1) This chapter attempts to predict what the future of programming languages looks like and, in the process, goes through the advantages and disadvantages of programming languages today.
2) “The desire for speed is so deeply ingrained in us, with our puny computers, that it will take a conscious effort to overcome it. In language design, we should be consciously seeking out situations where we can trade efficiency for even the smallest increase in convenience.” This is interesting to me because I have never thought in terms of convenience, and instead have learned to think only in terms of speed.  In my computer science classes, we always discussed time complexity and never convenience of language.
3) An aside: Why is the future going to be dark most of the time?
As languages continue to evolve, what will happen to programs that are already written?  Will future code need to work well or understand code from languages of the past?
4) No real points of contention here... I’ve never designed a language before and all his points seem relatively valid.
5) It’s hard to predict what the future holds.  As we continue to advance, the way we think about problems is going to change drastically including what we are trying to optimize (speed vs. convenience).


Chapter 12:
1) Chapter 12 is focused on the advantages of LISP as well as why certain languages bring competitive advantage to start ups
2) “Ordinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in.” I found this statement to be interesting because I never realized that the way I think is influenced by what I’ve learned thus far.  This also is very interesting especially with respect to the Hungry Academy.  Non-programmers are now going to start thinking in Ruby...
3) How do you decide whether or not to advance to a more powerful language?  He says anyone over the age of 25 can’t be expected to switch.  Are they then at a disadvantage? Should we be learning LISP?
4) Is it smart or even practical to continue switching to “the most powerful” language every time you start a project?
5) Don’t pigeonhole yourself into using particular languages.  It could limit the efficiency or usefulness of your code.


Chapter 13: 
1) Chapter 13 revolves around language choice and why the industry has 
2) “Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what “industry best practice” actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average.” This was facinating to me because it seems obvious, and yet even LivingSocial chooses the “industry standard” RoR.
3) PG makes it sound easy to be successful in technology: pick a hard problem and use LISP to solve it... Is that really a feasible solution?  If everyone switched to LISP, would PG then switch back to a different language just to be “different”?
4) Just because 1 line of LISP can replace 20 lines of C code doesn’t mean you can be 20 times more efficient.  That just doesn’t sound right... I might argue that more time is spent planning how to write a program than actually typing out the lines. 
5) Industry best practices don’t get you anything good... They only get


Chapter 14:
1) This chapter revolves around the key features a language needs to be the best language: succinctness, hackability, throwaway programs, libraries, efficiency, time, and redesign
2) “And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing throwaway programs, because that’s where big systems come from.“  This definitely seems to be true and is probably the root of a lot of legacies (even outside of programming).
3)  “But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code.” Interesting! Do people at LS profile their code? Is it not worth it?
4) “Expert hackers can tell a good language when they see one, and they’ll use it. Expert hackers are a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software, and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers will tend to use whatever language they use. Often, indeed, it is not merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the very people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other programmers what language to use.”  How is that working out for you, LISP?
5) When building a tool for others to use, always consider how the tool might actually grow to widespread popularity. Who is going to use it? How are they going to use it? What are they going to use it for?


Chapter 15:
1) This chapter is about the differences between design and research.
2) If you’re designing a tool, for example, you can design it for anyone from beginners to experts, and what’s good design for one group might be bad for another. The point is, you have to pick some group of users. I don’t think you can even talk about good or bad design except with reference to some intended user.
3) If you create a language, for what level of coder should you write it for?  Will the programming languages evolutionary tree have a beginner, intermediate, and expert branch?
4) No real complaints here...
5) Keep yourself motivated and have working code.  Morale is a big factor in writing great code.
