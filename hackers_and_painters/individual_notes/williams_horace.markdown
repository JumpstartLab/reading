Hackers and Painters - Reading Notes
============

Chapter 1
-------------


###1. Summary
True "intelligence" is strongly correlated with a certain type of intellectual creativity which in turn breeds an inherent penchant for non-conformism and interests that surpass the facile topics of mundane/mainstream culture games. This non-conformism and inability to get excited about the rules of everyday social interaction is what accounts for the social stigmatization (but also subsequent success) of so-called "nerds."

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I was surprised that PG seems to believe that "nerdiness" is something inculcated by parents during childhood (by encouraging them to think about stuff etc) - I would have expected it to develop almost in lieu of parental coaching (i.e. what happens when a naturally smart kid is left to develop their )

### 3. What question was unanswered?
How does PG's notion of "nerddom" translate to more contemporary (post-modern?) attitudes about nerdiness - i.e. nerdiness has become increasingly acceptable and even cool in mainstream society __AND__ nerdiness is no longer restricted to 70's/80's/90's nerd pursuits of DnD, etc, but rather is now taken just to mean "extremely deep interest/obsession with a certain topic"

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Isn't this a little petty? Why does a prominent and successful figurehead of Silicon Valley feel the need to begin his treatise on "Programmers for the rest of the world" by appealing to middle school stereotypes? Even if the points may be valid, it seems like the method of presentation actually damages the argument.

__ALSO:__ The experiences described in the chapter are clearly based on a middle-to-upper-middle class suburban lifestyle, and little regard is given to the possibility of other, potentially very different demographic/socioeconomic/geographic experiences.

### 5. Takeaways
   * "Nerdiness" is a prominent-enough social phenomenon that it merits examination beyond grade school assumptions
   * The intellectual abilities that make nerds interesting or successful also make it hard for them to function in the rigid limits of mainstream society
   * Our education system is heavily broken and mostly limits those with actual creativity or intelligence
   * PG is still bitter about being a teenager in suburbia



   Chapter 2
-------------


###1. Summary
As a "creative" discipline, hacking draws heavily from intuitive types of intelligence (creativity, empathy, trial-and-error). The fact that programming is usually eclipsed by Computer Science has led to a misdiagnosis of how to do it well and how to judge its product(i.e. software).

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
PG argues for programming as a "new medium" which is currently undergoing its pioneer years. It's interesting to consider the work of early programmers as analogous to that of early painters (Francesca, Giotto, Duccio, etc.) rather than their scientific contemporaries (Gallileo, Copernicus, Newton etc.)

### 3. What question was unanswered?
It's a little unclear what a work of "Code as Art" would look like. The analogies of programmers to other types of artists/creative types seem pretty good, but it's still the case that most programmers (us included) make their living as a part of some corporate apparatus. Maybe open source is the closest analogy?

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Not much. I'm much more sympathetic to this chapter than the first; in fact I sort of have to be, since he is basically advocating that people from non-scientific backgrounds (like yours truly) can still bring valuable creative intuition to the hacking table.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Hackers are more appropriately grouped with creative disciplines such as painting/architecture etc.
  * Intense concern for details and for "aesthetic" quality is essential to writing good code
  * Most large corporations misuse programming talent by treating them as technicians whose responsibility is to execute product design decisions rather than creative craftspeople who both imagine and execute.


     Chapter 3
-----------------


###1. Summary
Going back to the notion that nerds/hackers are inherently rebellious or non-conformist, PG suggests that a good way to recognize potentially innovative or transformative ideas is to recognize the things that a society tries to stimy. This hinges on the broader idea of "fashions," which PG says can be analyzed fairly objectively in terms of power dynamics

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Despite his prickly (prickish?) attitude on most topics, PG turns out to be fairly conciliatory toward society when it comes to raising objections. I would rather have expected a "man the barricades" type of attitude against social backwardness or conservatism.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
He is not very explicit about how we should best establish metrics for judging cultural fashions. He recognizes that moral and ideological fashions tend to be transient ideas that come in and out of style, but he still seems to think that there are certain "right" answers that you can figure out by thinking about them enough. 

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
This is pretty biased toward a White Male POV. PG seems to think that most "taboos" are fragile constructs thrown up by authorities (whether moral, political, religious, w/e) as a means of controlling a group of people. This is an easy thing to say for someone who has never been in need of protection via social engineering; it seems a bit narrow-minded, especially in the context of a profession that is notorious for its struggles with diversity and harrassment.

### 5. Takeaways
  * As an intelligent person you should seek to mentally question the intellectual or behaviorial barriers that societies put up.
  * Good ways of evaluating a societal fashion or opinion is to challenge it from the perspective of other societies, epochs, or worldviews.
  * Since actively challenging every fashion that confronts you can be cumbersome (or even dangerous), it's more prudent to keep these thoughts to yourself and use them primarily as a tool to hone your thinking abilities.


       Chapter 4
-----------------


###1. Summary
"Hacking" as a discipline favors an attitude of pushing barriers, challenging assumptions, and disobeying directives. These traits are the same ones that have given America a competitive edge in the form of creativity and production, and if society starts to stamp these traits out, it will result in a major productivity disaster for the country.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Great cities or creative centers throughout history (not just in America) are most distinct for their liberal spirit which promotes innovation and creativity. This is as true for industrial/technological innovation as it is for artistic innovation.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
How does the conspicuous success of some anti-establishment hackers prove this as a pattern that works for everyone else? 


### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
It's pretty self-aggrandizing to claim the traits associated with progress as inherent/common to your profession. As usual, there isn't much in the way of circumspection/self-awareness or doubt in the writing.


### 5. Takeaways
  * Challenging tradition/habit is essential to innovation and progress (duh?)
  * Inasmuch as "Americanness" exists, it is exemplified by the rebellious spirit of the early patriots - as well as the rebellious self-sufficiency championed by many hackers


       Chapter 5
-----------------


###1. Summary
The growth of the web as a medium for software distribution has had a beneficial effect on the profession - both because it lowers the barrier for entry and reduces the overhead involved with development, and because the style of working and developing that the web condones is actually more in line with the spirit of hacking and programming in general. The advantages that increasingly allow web-based software to take over from desktop applications are ironically the same as initially allowed desktop computers to take over from old mainframes (they give small developers a way in).

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
It's hard to know for sure whether the benefits PG points out come directly from the web/SaaS model or if it is more a question of a changing mentality (which could theoretically be applied just as well to traditional development). New means of distribution like the App store arguably lower the barrier to entry and the overhead of development while still allowing developers to release in a desktop environment.
*Interesting to see in this chapter the beginning of the "zoom-out" to explaining why startups are the best model for production in general

### 3. What question was unanswered?
After talking at length in the last chapter about hackers as the guardians or "canaries in the coalmine" of privacy infringement, PG doesn't spend much time talking about the privacy implications for moving everything to server-based software.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
The dismissive attitude toward the "non-hackers" involved in producing things is kind of unfortunate - more of the "only programmers can do it right" attitude.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Developers work best when they can strip away the layers of junk that traditionally cluttered most desktop development
  * Web development should be treated not just as a boost to the utility of websites and browser-based consumption but as a shift in the ways that software is developed in general. By giving developers greater control over their environment and reducing the barrier between developers and consumers it ultimately makes for more efficient (and better) software creation.
  * Ironically the ability of web-based software to provide better service for less money actually puts them at a marketing disadvantage (since they can less afford to spend individual attention on major accounts)
  * Putting data & services in the hands of a purpose-specific web startup can actually boost stability and security over self-administered local solutions (thanks to specialization of labor and expertise)


Chapter 6
-----------------


###1. Summary
While money is simply a fabricated system for exchanging value, wealth represents the actual possession of valuable goods. As a productive enterprise, startups are best used to try to creat wealth by introducing new value into the world.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Startups are not just a phenomenon of the dot-com era but rather part of a long tradition of leveraging risk and new technology to produce wealth. Technology turns out to basically mean the "techniques by which wealth is produced."

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Creating wealth by adding value to the world is obviously an admirable goal, but the fact remains that a _huge_ portion of our economy revolves around things other than creating value, so the inequality of wealth can't be simply ascribed to meritocracy.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While PG makes a good point that the quantity of wealth in the world isn't fixed (and thus people getting rich aren't necessarily doing so at the expense of others), it is still true that economic policy (and especially access to education) has a lot to do with the distribution of wealth.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Wealth equates to "economic goods" in the true sense; by bringing more goods into the world, you create more wealth
  * Startups provide a way to create great wealth b/c they give tremendous motivation and reward for performance as well as the means to leverage that motivation into success on a large scale.

Chapter 7
-----------------


###1. Summary
Since wages are determined by supply and demand, in a free market the wage someone is able to earn is actually commensurate to the wealth that they create. Thus it is not surprising that there is huge income inequality. 

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
PG draws a distinction between education and other measures of wealth/social class, when it can pretty easily be shown that these are connected as well.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
In true libertarian fashion, he fails to address the extreme advantages that come from having a lot of money to begin with (i.e. the people best positioned to create wealth were often those who had it to begin with)

PG: People make more money b/c their skills are more valuable, and thus this is not unfair
But: The means of acquiring skills (education) is heavily based on socioeconomic background, and thus there is still unfairness in the system.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
This argument overlooks the reason we treat money differently: it actually impacts your ability to live a healthy & fulfulling life. Being an olympic runner might make you successful, but not being one doesn't necessarily doom you to poverty. Being unable to make a decent living does, however.

Also, a lot of the metaphors in this chapter are based on applying modern class distinctions or ethical perceptions to historical situations, which doesn't necessarily work.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Many people's perception of wealth is colored by the mistaken perception that it is a finite source which should be divided equally (when in fact it is something that can be created)
  * In the past much wealth was acquired through conquest/theft/extortion etc. so it was more understandable that people would object to great fortunes
  * 

Chapter 8
-----------------


###1. Summary
Filtering spam with Bayesian probability filters is much easier and more reliable than using keyword-based filters because it is able to adapt to the individual email account and to the changing habits of the spammers.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Spam is best attacked as a business with a currently-effective economic model, and if you can reduce the effectiveness of that model, you eliminate the ability of spammers to stay afloat.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
uhhhh....where did this come from? One second we were reading about general social principles behind hacking and the economics of wealth, and now we're in the details of techniques for constructing spam filters?

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?


### 5. Takeaways
  * A major concern for spam filtering is avoiding false positives
  * even if a given spam filtering technique doesn't work right off the bat, it can still be helpful by constraining the types of spam that can get past the filter (which in turn makes it easier to design filters for these remaining ones)


Chapter 9
-----------------


###1. Summary
Rather than a subjective, wishy-washy concept, "taste" is a very real thing that is connected to good design. By studying good design and pushing for solutions that have that _je ne sais quoi_, we can improve our taste.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I like the idea that there is a certain universal notion of beauty or elegance which most practitioners try to instill in their work regardless of discipline.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
Programming can obviously take a lot from "Less is more" but does it have an aesthetic equivalent of "Less is a bore."

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While I generally agree with the principle, some of the examples are a little oversimplified or stretched, which does make you skeptical. While many of Leonardo's techniques do fit PG's model, there are certainly other great artists who did things completely differently. 

### 5. Takeaways
  * If you find a solution for something that works but isn't the most beautiful, it will eventually be surpassed by someone who can make it functional _and_ beautiful.
  * Good designs give flexible solutions that can adapt to (and even promote) unforeseen uses
  * The development of good taste often comes full-circle to a state of confident imitation or extension of previous work



Chapter 10
-----------------


###1. Summary
Languages funnel instructions to machines. A hierarchy of languages is used to efficiently get instructions down to the hardware while still allowing us to think in relatively human terms and to work more efficiently. Beyond this there are a lot of different languages and at least as many scales of evaluation along which they can be compared.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Just like Jeff said on day one - computer time is cheap and programmer time is expensive (while it used to be the opposite). Thus we get to use nice things like Ruby instead of gross things like Assembly.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
The chapter was interesting and sort of fun, but it would have been cool to get a more extensive summary of the broad philosophies behind a handful of popular languages - an ethnography of sorts of the current language landscape.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
He didn't talk about ruby? :(

### 5. Takeaways
  * Most languages can be used to accomplish roughly the same tasks, but you still want to be sensitive to choosing the right tool for the job.
  * Like most areas of computer tech, the cheapening of hardware has led to a great proliferation in new languages (as practically anyone now has the means to write one).


Chapter 11
-----------------


###1. Summary
Programming languages are an ever-changing field of inquiry and their ongoing development can be traced similarly to organic evolution. By looking at the types of languages that have proved successful and the types that have died out, we can learn lessons about what makes a good language and how to better design new ones. Assuming that programming will be roughly the same discipline in 100 yrs as now, we can expect that languages in 100 years will still need to meet 2 challenges: make things easy and run efficiently when necessary. Since being able to run efficiently is a prerequisite, we could presumably use such a language today (even if we had to do lots of optimizing to it). This produces the better mindset of aiming where we want to go in the long term rather than where we want to go in the near future.
  * "One way to design a language is to just write down the program you'd like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it."

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
I really liked the explanation of languages based on "fundamental operators" and "everything else." The idea of coming up with an elegant but flexible set of fundamental instructions is a really interesting design problem, and it's interesting to consider the ways in which a languages broader tendencies follow formally from the basic underlying instructions.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
PG guesses that even in 100 years we still won't be able to "just tell computers what we want them to do" because there hasn't been much progress thus far. But really? _All_the progress that has ever been made on computers - period - dates to about 60 years ago, and most signs indicate it has been speeding up during that time. So this seems like an unreliable way to diagnose what will be possible 100 years from now.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While the notion of "stay on a main branch" obviously makes some sense for language design, it sort of seems counter to the antiestablishment spirit of innovation championed in earlier chapters. It seems like the branches of languages that die out are still incredibly important for the lessons that they teach the discipline as a whole.

### 5. Takeaways
  * The design of languages follows the patterns outlined in ch. 9 - A good way to design something good is to try to think of something timeless 
  * A good way to understand a language is to look at its underlying principles
  * Generally, these should be made as simple and few as possible
  * As hardware continues to get faster, there will be good ways to use the extra speed and bad ways - a good way is to take advantage of it to improve the elegance of our language and software designs (another case of people time being more valuable than computer time)


Chapter 12
-----------------


###1. Summary
Programming languages should be examined from the perspective of overall power and abstractness (rather than specific featuresets). Lisp turns out to be an extremely powerful language because of XXX, and because of this, it can be reliably used to produce great applications, even if this is not a common use for it. 

### 2. What stood out or surprised?


### 3. What question was unanswered?
How can you really claim to prove one language to be "most powerful"? Maybe this is sarcasm? The problem is the same as what PG identifies with the analogy of the language continuum - it's always hard to perceive those things that are higher up than you are, so if there is something higher than Lisp, how will he be able to know he isn't just missing it because Lisp is his favorite.

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
PG's assumption that since Lisp supposedly makes you a better programmer, it should also result in better programs isn't really accurate to what the other sources are saying. When Eric Raymond says Lisp will teach you things but you won't actually use it, this is because the things that make a language educational and the things that make it useful aren't necessarily the same. PG's argument seems to conflate these 2 things.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Startups rely more on technological edge than traditional companies, and thus need to be more keenly aware of choosing the best tool for the job
  * Programmers are very habitual and hidebound when it comes to language selection; it is important to be on the lookout for new developments and try not to let yourself get stuck in a rut


Chapter 13
-----------------


###1. Summary
The main features that all programming languages eventually evolve toward are abstraction and flexibility (in terms of the language itself, not just the availability of libraries, etc.) Ironically, Lisp, because of its unusual origins, was very well-designed to meet these goals all the way back in 1958, and has just been waiting for a chance to get into mainstream use. Meanwhile, other languages have slowly evolved to incorporate many of the features that Lisp originally introduced.


### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Didn't realize ruby was somewhat lisp-like (at least according to PG). It seems like this similarity comes from the way Ruby handles blocks? A block is like a function that can be evaluated in-line without having to be defined with explicit returns?

### 3. What question was unanswered?
What is the difference between writing macros and metaprogramming in Ruby? I guess i need a more noob-friendly intro to macros...

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
It's still not that clear why Lisp never really got used if it is so great. Part of PG's argument is that even the first Lisp from 1958 basically had the features that make the language great, but if that's the case why did it take people 50 years to realize it? Is this just because it is hard?

### 5. Takeaways
  * Lisp's power comes from the fact that it was developed as a mathematical exercise rather than a programming language, and other languages have slowly been incorporating some of its ideas (becoming more Lisp-like)
  * The advantages of using powerful languages are obvious - they let you solve more complex problems; the disadvantages, however, are more circumstantial - and are disappearing in the age of web applications


Chapter 14
-----------------

###1. Summary
While there are a lot of extraneous and conflicting factors that determine the success of languages, what matters most is how useful they are to actual programmers. At the end of the day (or given enough time) the better languages probably do rise to the top. The factors that accelerate this are their distribution and their usefulness for solving a common problem. Beyond this, succinctness and the ability to accomplish what we want make our lives easier and, all else being equal, lead to greater adoption.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Abstractions aren't necessarily things that get a language closer to English - they simply make something conceptually more elegant, which can theoretically be expressed in any syntax so long as it is short and relatively simple.


### 3. What question was unanswered?


### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
While I pretty much agree, I do think a certain amount of explicitness and boilerplate helps guide the brain along the same track as the language. Maybe this is just a beginner's impulse that will fade over time.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Languages become popular by a) being good and b) being the de facto tool for working in a certain system; a language that can do both of these will probably be successful
  * The best languages will be designed to give the user freedom to discover things that the designer couldn't think of - rather than to try to protect him from what the designer perceives as dangerous
  * +1 for Ruby - letting programmers override inherent functionality of the language adds tremendous freedom, even if it is used sparingly
  * speed only matters in the bottlenecks - so the way to make something fast is to provide the tools for identifying the bottlenecks rather than trying to change the whole thing for the sake of a handfull of situations.


Chapter 15
-----------------

###1. Summary
Research and design represent two "forks" on the path to progress. Design is more concerned with making things work for people, and since programming languages need to work for people, they have a lot to learn from the design process. Specifically, this means thinking about things ergonomically from the perspective of the users and working iteratively to improve on solutions.

### 2. What stood out or surprised?
Interesting that he starts to group programming with the Arts. I like it.

### 3. What question was unanswered?
The idea of approaching programming in this way makes total sense to me, so I wish there had been more discussion of why the discipline is generally perceived as the domain of "science-nerds." (no offense to said nerds)

### 4. Objections? Disagreements?
Like some of the other chapters, I totally agree with the sentiment but I think the obsession with surface-level metaphors weakens the argument. I would rather have seen him dive into some deeper analysis of why/how iteration works from a conceptual/philosophical level than have more pithy one-liners about oil paint/marble/whatever.

### 5. Takeaways
  * Research & Design can achieve similar results but with different processes
  * While many people consider "design" as the aesthetic enterprise of making things look good, it actually has more to do with an analytical and iterative approach to problem solving from a human-centric perspective (_ArchitectRant: This word actually comes from the Italian word for "drawing" (_Disegnio_, or something like that, and it originated during the Renaissance when the study of perspective system ))
