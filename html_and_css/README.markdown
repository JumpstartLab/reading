## Assignment

For this book we will:

* Begin reading & working on Monday 3/12
* Submit the exercises you create by 3/16
* Complete submitted exercises and reading by 3/26

### Part 1 - Creating Exercises

Each of you will have one segment of the book (commonly a chapter, but
the largest chapters will be split two ways) for which you write the
exercises. We'll share these exercises and all complete them as we
read. You'll be provided a reference example for one chapter and
guidelines about timing, content, and difficulty.

The chapters are not order dependent, so the expectation is that
you'll read/work through the segment you're assigned, create your
exercises, then read and work through all the other chapters as those
exercises become available.

Details on creating the exercises are below. Exercises are due by 11:59pm on 3/16.

### Part 2 - Reading & Exercises

Read the entire book and complete all peer-designed exercises by reading group on 3/26.

### Designing Exercises

For your chapter, design an exercise which can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes. Here's how you can do that:

#### Logistics

* Write your exercise instructions in `html_and_css/exercises/chapterXX.markdown`
* Store any resources in `html_and_css/resources/chapterXX/`
* If you're able to reuse any resources from other chapters, store them in `html_and_css/resources/common/`

#### How to Write Exercises

1. Determine the most important concepts and details from your chapter. What are the things that you MUST know about this subject? The nuances and "tricks" aren't our focus. What are the big ideas, the essentials?
2. How can those best be practiced? Does it mean adding style to an existing layout? Reformatting a block of plain text into valid markup?
3. What does the worker need to being? We don't want to start from scratch 19 times. If you're focused on the HTML box model in CSS, create a simple HTML document they can start with.
4. Write instructions that are clear but still require some brain function. You're not programming a computer, you're instructing a human who can take abstract ideas and convert them into critical steps. Don't re-explain details that are in the text, just reference where they can find help in the book.
4. How can outcomes be measured or validated?
