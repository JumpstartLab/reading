## HTML & CSS

Let's read and work through HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett: http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118008189/

## Assignment

For this book we will:

* Begin reading & working on Monday 3/12
* Submit the exercises you create by 3/16
* Complete submitted exercises and reading by 3/26

### Part 1 - Creating Exercises

Each chapter has one or two people assigned to writing exercises. We'll share these exercises and all complete them as we read.

The chapters are not order dependent, so the expectation is that you'll read/work through the segment you're assigned, create your exercises, then read and work through all the other chapters as those exercises become available.

Details on creating the exercises are below. Exercises are due by 11:59pm on 3/16.

### Part 2 - Reading & Exercises

Read the entire book and complete all peer-designed exercises by reading group on 3/26.

### Designing Exercises

#### Logistics

* For your chapter, design a set of exercises which can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes
* Write your exercise instructions in `html_and_css/exercises/chapterXX.markdown`
* Store any resources in `html_and_css/resources/chapterXX/`
* If you're able to reuse any resources from other chapters, store them in `html_and_css/resources/common/`

#### How to Write Exercises

1. Determine the most important concepts and details from your chapter. What are the things that you MUST know about this subject? The nuances and "tricks" aren't our focus. What are the big ideas, the essentials?
2. How can those best be practiced? Does it mean adding style to an existing layout? Reformatting a block of plain text into valid markup?
3. What does the worker need to begin? We don't want to start from scratch 19 times. If you're focused on the HTML box model in CSS, create a simple HTML document they can start with. If they're practicing structuring HTML, give them a chunk of text, like the Bill of Rights, to work with.
4. Write instructions that are clear but still require some brain function. You're not programming a computer, you're instructing a human who can take abstract ideas and convert them into critical steps. Don't re-explain details that are in the text, just reference where they can find help in the book.
5. Consider using a "choose your own adventure" style like our projects. Define "Base Expectations" that need to be completed, then add optional "Extensions" to push the challenge further.
6. How can outcomes be measured or validated? How can they know it worked properly? Consider providing screenshots for comparison.
7. Create a reference implementation in `html_and_css/exercise_solutions/chapterXX`

## Review Protocol

### Phase 1 - Individual

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your completed exercises as `html_and_css/exercises/githubusername/chapter01/index.html` for each chapter. Instead of copying resources, try referencing them directly from the resources folder.
3. Push to Github
4. Submit a pull request

### Phase 2 - Peer Review
