# Chapter One

1 What are the parts of a tag? (use `<p lang= "en-US">Call me maybe...</p>` as a reference)  
* Opening tag "<p lang= "en-US">" consists of brackets, the tag name (here p, also referred to as character - odd), the attributes (lang), and attribute value (en-us)
* Closing tag consists of a forward slash and the tag name enclosed in brackets  

2 What is the structure of HTML?
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p></p>
  </body>
<html>

3 What does HTML stand for?

  Hyper
  
  Text
  
  Markup
  
  Language
  
4 Create a haiku about HTML, demonstrating your understanding of the topic.

To view pre-made sites
I always click 'view source'
Just to look, not steal


5 If I put text between body tags, where does that text show up in Safari 3.2? In IE 4rc1?

<body> puts text in the main document of the site. I would imagine unformatted body text would render similarly in different browsers, but without testing, it's hard to know!


6 When creating a `<head>` tag, does this information show up on the rendered document?

Nope!
