p## Chapter 08 Exercises

### Part 1 - Setup

Grab the ponies.html file from html_and_css/resources/chapter08/. Edit the file in Sublime Text and open the file from a web browser to see how your changes are taking effect.

### Part 2 - Exercises

All of the exercises will be completed by editing the ponies.html file from html_and_css/resources/chapter08/

1. Set the DOCTYPE of the file to use HTML5
2. Insert a comment anywhere in the file that tells us your favorite pony.
3. On your favorite pony's <li> element, insert an id attribute called "favorite"
4. In ponies.html, insert a <div> element with the id "ponies" that contains all of the pony names and their related elements.
5. Insert a <span> element with the class "lame" around 'Dora the Explorer'.

At this point, if you've completed each task successfully, reloading the page should not cause any changes to occur. Are you seeing any changes?

  * Source: http://mylittlepony.com
