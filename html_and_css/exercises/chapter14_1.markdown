### Super Extention for List
* Use an unordered list to make a navigation bar. You'll be using some CSS styles that we haven't discussed as well as some we have. List items will not have bullets. They'll have a defined height and width. They'll be displayed horizontally instead of vertically. Consider where the <a> </a> tags go in your list - do they turn the entire list item into a button or just the text? Which is the functionality you'd prefer?


### Something new

### Extension
* Make empty cells' borders invisible - except when you mouse over the cell.
