# Chapter 5#
### Images ###

#### Use the provided images and HTML file to do the following. ####

1. Use ipiccy.com to open up the provided photo Gatsby.jpg and resize to 400 pixels tall and 300 pixels wide.

2. Embed it in the  first paragraph justified to the left and contains a title, alt description and dimensions of the file.

3. Embed it above the next paragraph, but with a figure caption.

4. In ipiccy.com, crop the provided logos for the Hungry Academy so only your preferred version is still present and embed in the document above the title.
  * be sure that you keep the transparency!

GENERAL NOTE:
Images are now typically edited/manipulated with CSS, but for the sake of this exercise, just do it with HTML.  When you get to chapter 16, you will learn the current method.
