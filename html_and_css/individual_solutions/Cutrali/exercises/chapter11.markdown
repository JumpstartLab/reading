#Chapter 11 - Color
###Instructions:
1. Grab the HTML file:
  - The file is called `chapter11exercise.html` and you can [locate it here](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/blob/master/html_and_css/resources/chapter11/chapter11exercise.html).
2. Open the file in an editor.
3. _For "Step 1":_
  - Replace the text "Step 1" with your name.
  - Give this `<div>` a dark background-color with __rgb values__.
  - Give the "Step 1" text a light font color that is readable given the background-color.
4. _For "Step 2":_
  - Replace the text "Step 2" with one of your favorite songs, including the artist.
  - Give this `<div>` a different background-color than the one above with __hex values__.
  - Give the text a new font color that contrasts well with its background-color.
5. _For "Replace me":_
  - Replace this text with an explanation of why you love the song you chose.
  - Give this `<div>` a light background-color with a dark font. Make at least one of these have a __color name__.
6. _For the image:_
  - Give the beast full opacity on hover.

###Expectations:
- Complete the exercises above.

###Nice to Know:
- You will find the selectors needed to complete this exercise in the `<head>` tag of `chapter11exercise.html`. (Again, this in `html_and_css/resources/chapter11`). If you don't want to use the ones I provide, you can make your own.

###References:
- For hints about giving color to text, see page 249 .
- For hints about giving color to background, see page 250 .
- For hints about opacity, see page 254 .
- To find hex/rgb colors, here are two resources I like to use:
 - <a href="http://colorschemer.com/online.html" target="blank">Color Schemer Online</a>
 - Digital Color Meter - access this by searching for it in Spotlight
- For a list of color names, check <a href="http://www.learningwebdesign.com/colornames.html" target="blank">this reference</a>.
- To check your contrast, use <a href="http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html" target="blank">this reference</a> provided in the book.

###Bonus:
- Since you're a pro and completed all of the tasks in 5 minutes, try your hand at the following:
  - Change the background-color of `&lt;div id="instructions"&gt;` to to either hsl or hsla. (See page 256 for pointers.)
  - Add a new `<div>` above these instructions. Inside of that newly created `<div>`, point out something I could've done better - either with this example or my color selection.
