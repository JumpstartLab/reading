A guy sitting for a caricature asked the artist, "Does it look good?"
The artist replied "Well, no... but it looks like you."

In that spirit, here are some instructions to make the ugly form screenshotted in this folder. :)

Pull the screenshot from the Git repository(/reading/html_and_css/exercise/chapter14.png
Pull the example source from http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-07/example.html

Make the corners of the text boxes rounded off, like bubbles instead of boxes. But don't
change the styling of the submit button; that should stay the same. 

The background color of the text boxes should be a dusty rose color.

There should be at least 10 pixels between the text boxes and any other form element.

When your mouse overs over the submit button, it should turn into the "I'm about to click
a link" pointing hand.

If you're hovering over *or* typing in the comments box, it should have a black background
and white text. At all other times, it should be the opposite (white background, black text.)

The "Your Details" and "Your Review" fieldsets should be 350 pixels wide, and have a
pure-red border around them. I'm thinking the borders should be 5 pixels thick. Behind the
"Your Details" and "Your Review" text, I'd like a cyan background.

Extension 1:

Add a star icon to each of the text input boxes 

Extension 2:

Spread out the radio buttons so that they're as wide as the comments box.
