  <h2>5 Things to look at for poor optimization</h2>
  <p>Given that this is under 'google analytics' I assume the request is for signs in Analytics that SEO might need address. IE that the site is not optimized to bring the right people's eyeballs in.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low average visit duration</li>
    <li>High bounce rate</li>
    <li>Demographics - is it hitting the target regions/demographic sectors</li>
    <li>Traffic sources - are the words I inted to target the ones people are using to find my site</li>
    <li>New vs Returning - how is this ratio. A bad ratio = changes needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hosting</h2>
  <p>I host my sites with MediaTemple, use Transmit for my FTP and CushyCMS for basic content management, WordPress on the rare occasion someone needs a more robust CMS solution.</p>
