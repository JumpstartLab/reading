1  Parts of a tag:
'<p lang= "en US">' is the opening tag.  this indicates that a tag is beginning, what type of tag it is (here, a paragraph).  This tag also includes other optional information- an attribute name and value that indicate the language in this example
'Call me maybe...' is the content of this tag...and a VERY annoying song
