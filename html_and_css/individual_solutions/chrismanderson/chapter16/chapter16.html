	<img src="../../../resources/chapter16/images/ash.png" alt="" class="small left"/>Magnolia is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering plant species. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol and, having evolved before bees appeared, the flowers were developed to encourage pollination by beetle.

	Some magnolias, such as Magnolia stellata and Magnolia soulangeana, flower quite early in the spring before the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, such as Magnolia grandiflora.
