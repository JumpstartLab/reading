<!-- # Chapter 09: Flash Video and Audio

###Base Expectations:
Complete Exercises 1-9 per the instructions here by embedding audio and video files into the HTML page 'Flash Video & Audio.html' included in resources/chapter09.  You may use the sample audio and video files supplied under their respective folders in resources/chapter09.  Please note that the CSS for the HTML page has been configured so as to center all elements once they are placed on the page, per the reference implementation.

###Exercises:
1. Embed a flash movie into the web page.
2. Embed a flash video into the web page.
3. Embed an .mp4 HTML5 video into the web page that does not loop or pre-load any content.
4. Embed a WebM HTML5 video into the web page that automatically loops and does not show any image until the video plays.
5. Embed an HTML5 video into the web page that uses multiple video sources and that automatically plays as soon as the page has loaded.
6. Embed a youtube video into the web page of your choosing (read the HTML comments).
7. Add a flash .mp3 player to the web page.
8. Add an HTML5 audio player to the web page that plays an .ogg file, has controls, does not pre-load any data, and loops when played. 
9. Add an HTML5 audio player to the web page that plays an .mp3 file, has controls, and automatically plays as soon as the page has loaded.
10. Embed a file from SoundCloud into the web page and ensure that the file successfully plays.

###Extensions:
1. Embed at least one flash video, one HTML5 video, and one audio file of your own creation into the web page (e.g., that is not hosted video or audio and that is not provided with the resources accompanying this exercise).
2. Implement a custom rewind button for any of of the elements you have embedded using Javascript. -->
