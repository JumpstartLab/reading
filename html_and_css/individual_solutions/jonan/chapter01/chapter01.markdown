## Challenge yourself!

In 2000 words or less, describe the travel of a packet of information from your home computer to a server.

A packet leaves your computer with a destination address and some portion of a information that you are sending, traveling to your nearest upstream network device and being routed forward to the next nearest along your destination path. Each computer or device along the path sends your packet along to the next device that is closest to your destination until it arrives.
