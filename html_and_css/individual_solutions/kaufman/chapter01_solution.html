Extra: Your machine will often need to communicate with servers around the world while you browse the internet. The most common example of communicating with a server is requesting the content for the web page. Your machine will have already communicated with the DNS server and know the ip address of the appropriate server. It will then send a request to that ip address that contains your machine's own IP address and, also, what information is needed (for instance the html for index.html).
