## 5 Data Points to Investigate Poor Site Optimization:

1. Bounce rate - this is the number of people who left on the same page that they arrived on; a high bounce rate suggests that the content wasn't what they were looking for
2. Top exit pages - shows which pages people most commonly leave from, if a lot of people are leaving from that page it's a strong indicator that that site needs to be improved
3. Landing Pages - shoes the pages people arrive on when first visiting your site; if people aren't coming into your site via the homepage it can suggest that your website is poorly constructed
4. Search terms - can help you learn how visitors describe what they're looking for when they arrive on your site, which you in turn can tweak in your page to optimize your page's ranking in prospective visitors' searches
5. Pages - shows which pages visitors are spending the most time with, which can suggest a re-arrangement or re-structuring of content, if necessary
