# Chapter One

1 What are the parts of a tag? (use <p lang= "en-US">Call me maybe...</p> as a reference)

Bracket delimiters, containing a marker describing the type of tag ('p', in this example,
means 'paragraph'), a collection of key-value pairs describing attributes (such as lang='en-us'),
and a closing tag. 

2 What is the structure of HTML?
Nested elements

3 What does HTML stand for?
  Hyper
  Text
  Markup
  Language

4 Create a haiku about HTML, demonstrating your understanding of the topic.
<head><body><h1>
Context in springtime, header
complete.</h1>


5 If I put text between body tags, where does that text show up in Safari 3.2? In IE 4rc1?

In the main browser window.

6 When creating a <head> tag, does this information show up on the rendered document?

It's not supposed to - the head is a collection of instructions for the browser.
However, if you put markup tags in the head (such as <p>), they will display.
