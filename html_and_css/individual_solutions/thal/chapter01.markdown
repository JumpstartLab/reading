<!--->
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1></h1>
  <p></p>
  <h2></h2>
  <p></p>
  </body>
</html>
<---->


3 What does HTML stand for?
Hyper
Text
Markup
Language
4 Create a haiku about HTML, demonstrating your understanding of the topic.

A website framework
with semantic tags
to format information

5 If I put text between body tags, where does that text show up in Safari 3.2? In IE 4rc1?


6 When creating a <head> tag, does this information show up on the rendered document?

The information does not show up in the body of the document, but if there is css there then it will show up in how it is styled, if there is javascript it will show up in how it works, and if there is something in side the title tag you will see it at the top of the browser.
## Challenge yourself!

In 2000 words or less, describe the travel of a packet of information from your home computer to a server.
When you type in a url, the DNS sends back the IP address that your browser should navigate to, when it goes to that IP address, the computer (server) at that address sends back information to your browser (at the proper port) if it is allowed.
