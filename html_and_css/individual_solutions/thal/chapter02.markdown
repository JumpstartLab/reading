### Overview

Goals
By the end of the exercise, you should be able to beautifully style and format text on your webpages. Brace yourselves to learn about a bunch of stuff I like: Nerdy jokes abound.

The exercise, located in the resources folder, is entitled format_me.html and is split into two sections:

* Structural markup - used to format headings and paragraphs
* Semantic markup - used to provide extra information (e.g. quotes, citation, emphasis, etc.)

The instructions are pretty self-explanatory and have been incorporated into the exercise.  Happy formatting!
