<<<<<<< HEAD
An opening tag has a left-angle bracket, some characters (p, in this case), and a right-angle bracket.

A closing tag has a left-angle bracket, a forward slash, some characters, and a right-angle bracket.

2 What is the structure of HTML?
HTML has a head, a title (inside the head), and a body.

Bracket delimiters, containing a marker describing the type of tag ('p', in this example,
means 'paragraph'), a collection of key-value pairs describing attributes (such as lang='en-us'),
and a closing tag.

<<<<<<< HEAD
A fast way to make,
All of the thoughts in my head,
For web consumption.

5 If I put text between body tags, where does that text show up in Safari 3.2? In IE 4rc1?
That text shows up in the main browser window.

6 When creating a <head> tag, does this information show up on the rendered document?
It will show up in the rendered document, but this isn't good style. Theoretically, nothing in the head should show up in the body of the document.

5 If I put text between body tags, where does that text show up in Safari 3.2? In IE 4rc1?

In the main browser window.

6 When creating a <head> tag, does this information show up on the rendered document?

It's not supposed to - the head is a collection of instructions for the browser.
However, if you put markup tags in the head (such as <p>), they will display.
