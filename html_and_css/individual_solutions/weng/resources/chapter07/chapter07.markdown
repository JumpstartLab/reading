# Base Expectations 

Make a form of **related** elements of user information. 

1. Copy index.html from *resources/chapter07* and use it as your form template.
2. Your finished form can look something like the screenshot in *resources/chapter07/example.png*

*Your form action does not need to point to a real webserver.*

## Form Elements
* First Name
* Last Name
* Password with characters blocked out
* A gender radio button (Male or Female)
* A control to select all your favorite beverages: ex. Water, Fruit Juice, Soda, Ethanol, etc
* Submit button


# Extensions
* Take a look at the submitted request playload with a http request inspector. Hint: Chrome allows you to inspect the request payload with it's debugger.
* Add HTML 5 form elements to your form.
* Compare other types of form validation(JQuery, Prototype, Dojo, etc) with HTML5
  form validation.
