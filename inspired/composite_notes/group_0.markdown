### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"

Yes, because when you have a small team you can come up with your overall goal of what you would like to do together. From this you typically don't need a dedicated PM or 'customer' because you have set the vision of where you are going together.

#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"

Advantages:
You have one clear vision of what and how the product's end result should function.

Disadvantages:
You may not be able to give enough attention to each category, resulting in you doing both jobs not as well as you could do anyone job.

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

In this type of schema you would need a product council to allocate resources, and keep people on the same path. They would be responsible for setting the overall direction of the company based on the input from the smaller teams.

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"

Be cautious of what your overall end goal, be it the most points, prettiest, or best code. Some user experience guide would be helpful aswell.
