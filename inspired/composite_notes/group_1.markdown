### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"
  * Most Ruby projects are fairly small, so won't necessarily have the money required to run a project in the way the book describes.
  * Someone needs to have the responsibility but in a small group it may not be their only role.

#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"
  * Disadvantages
    * Conflicting priorities between scheduling and making the right product
  * Advantages
    * No miscommunication about what is realistic
    * User priorities sometimes win

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"
  * This is probably what the product council is for
  * Product people still talk to product people
  * There was probably a strategy in how the teams were organized to avoid this

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"
  * HiFi Prototyping (Keynotopia)
  * Segmentation of team
