### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"

#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"
