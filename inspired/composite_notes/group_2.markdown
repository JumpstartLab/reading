### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on
projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"

Absolutely. Small teams work best when each member is able and willing to wear
many hats.

#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product
Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and
disadvantages?"

This will work for a small team, but any large team will need distinct roles.

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will
segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we
still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

Cultivate an open culture where shared ideas are heard and celebrated.

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our
Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"

As our project teams grow in size it will become increasingly important for
individual members to take responsibility for their individual roles, and own
their own products.
