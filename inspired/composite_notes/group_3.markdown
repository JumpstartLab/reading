# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group 3

Group members: 

Austen, Tom, Mark, Andy

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"
 
* They have every chance of succeeding- these things are not necessary to success
*  Example: the creation of rails was not sparked by a customer, it was organically grown
* Perhaps these elements make it more likely to succeed
* On small teams, someone is taking over the role of PM
* If your product is large enough, it is likely be needed


#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"

*  Advantage: all knowledge compiled into one source.
* Disadvantage: super large projects probably room for error.
* All based on scale/complexity
* Schedule vs. Passion should live in separate entities



#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

* Communication between teams is definitely challenging
* There has to be a single point of communication somewhere up the org chart
* The project managers have to work together closely to coordinate their teams
* We've had problems with duplicated efforts in past; this approach will probably sort that out
* Need to keep focused on communicating with other teams; we have a status document that we're pioneering for that.

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"

* Have defined roles in our teams. UX person, interaction designer. Have someone wear the product manager hat.
* Usability testing with our projects early to find issues and usability flaws.
* Before the project starts, be a project manager or the UX person as a group. Then you can talk through the issues related to the role.
