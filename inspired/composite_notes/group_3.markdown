# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group 3

Group members: 

Austen, Tom, Mark, Andy

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"

-They have every chance of succeeding- these things are not necessary to success
-Example: the creation of rails was not sparked by a customer, it was organically grown
-Perhaps these elements make it more likely to succeed
-On small teams, someone is taking over the role of PM
-If your product is large enough, it is likely be needed


#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"

-Advantage: all knowledge compiled into one source.
-Disadvantage: super large projects probably room for error.
-All based on scale/complexity
-Schedule vs. Passion should live in separate entities



#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

-Communication between teams is definitely challenging
-There has to be a single point of communication somewhere up the org chart
-The project managers have to work together closely to coordinate their teams
-We've had problems with duplicated efforts in past; this approach will probably sort that out
-Need to keep focused on communicating with other teams; we have a status document that we're pioneering for that.

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"

- Have defined roles in our teams. UX person, interaction designer. Have someone wear the product manager hat.
- Usability testing with our projects early to find issues and usability flaws.
- Before the project starts, be a project manager or the UX person as a group. Then you can talk through the issues related to the role.
