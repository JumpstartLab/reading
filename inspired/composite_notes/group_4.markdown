# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group

Group members: Chris Maddox, Mike Chlipala, Horace Williams, Jacqueline Chenault

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"

* Rubyists more likely to be generalists? More design/PM talent among rubyists than other programming disciplines?

* Scale is completely different - many rubyists may be working in small groups but also often on smaller-scale projects.

* MegaCorps run into the issue of "customer empathy" (i.e. identifying with their target user), but many people in the Ruby/OSS community work on projects for other devs, so they are the target audience.

* Smaller team means higher concentration of smart people - less chaff to way the team down. "EVERY ONE IS A GENIUS" - Mike C. 


#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"

* Disadv they'll fail and never get anything done right.

* When one person is making decisions about both the timeline adn the direction of the project, it's almost inveitable that you'll lean one way or the other, so no shorcuts will be taken for one over the other - they'll steer too hard in one direction over the other.

* A lot of times the product manager needs to stand up and say no or say 'do it right' and as soon as you conflate that role with someone else it is hard for them to stand up in that way.

* Wish he'd been talking more about ideology and broad ideas rather than didactic. Less large perscriptions.

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"

* Individual products get large enough to be their own companies, so if you're on the Deals team, you're actually part of a separate unit

* Above all of the teams is a pretty clear idea of what the common direction is, but it makes sense to separate people out and set goals for individual teams

* there are lots of issues with that model. Many of the services don't play nicely with each other, when two teams build products with a single sign-on but don't talk to each other.

* All the services should share a common API to communicate.

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"

* We could potentially divide up into distinct roles that are in charge of different pieces of the project. ...this could be hard though, especially because you need some unified vision to minimize conflicts and issues in the code.

* Having distinct roles may be effective. This allows separate team members to focus on separate pieces of the project without worrying about overwriting other's changes. 

* ...but we're still exploring Rails and we want to learn all of the things, so assigning roles could be limiting.

* the conclusion is that it's inconclusive. considering product specs are given to us, we may not necessarily need a strong PM-role. instead, maybe "soft-titles" could work.
