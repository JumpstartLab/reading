# Small Group Discussion of "Drive"

### Group 5

Group members: Charles, Darrell, Ed, Travis

### Discussion Summary

#### A: "Most of the Ruby community is made up of small teams working on projects without a dedicated PM or 'customer'. Can they possibly succeed?"
  We think it's possible, especially since in his book he said that he found engineers that can be PMs.  Plus, the only role of the PM is to keep focus on the user and delivering on time, not necessarily the work on the product.  

#### B: "In some teams, one person might have to serve as both the Product Manager and the Project Manager. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages?"
  Advantages:
  • Better grasp of the big picture (product status, team availability, etc.)
  • Costs less
  • Less coordination amongst team

  Disadvantages:
  • Time (not able to come up with more ideas) and focus (not able to allocate fully to one role)

#### C: "You already know LivingSocial is moving towards this approach. It will segment people into smaller specialties, only working on one tool. How can we still cross-pollinate ideas and avoid diverging paths?"
  • Having large group meetings to discuss what each group is doing
  • Having group rotations every month or so to transfer ideas
  • Making sure the PM is keeping focus within the group internally to avoid divergence

#### D: "How can we take some of the ideas from Inspired and work them into our Hungry Academy curriculum / projects / etc?"
