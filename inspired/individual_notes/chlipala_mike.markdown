Inspired Notes - Mike Chlipala

ch_1 - Successful product teams include product managers, engineers, product marketers, interaction designers, visual designers, and ops.

ch_2 - you should separate product management and product marketing management. PM defines the product to be built, PMM defines positioning, pricing, training the sales team, etc.

ch_3 - great organizations separate project management from product management - this is especially useful in internet companies where project mgmt should span product, engineering, and ops

ch_4 - good design can help differentiate your product. think twice before outsourcing interaction design as it's inherently a very hands-on process.

ch_5 - inspired engineers create better products - get them in front of users. As a PM, minimize churn once eng starts developing the product; answer questions and squash issues as soon as possible to keep things running smooth.

ch_6 - great product managers will posses a unique combination of technical and business skills that both allows them to work with the technical team to define the produce and also "sell" the product's vision to upper management. these people are extremely hard to find, but few hires will be as important as this one.

ch_7 - inadequate PMs are almost certain to fail and they should be moved immediately to a different position. a strong PM team will produce a strong set of products for the company.

ch_8 -  the more latitude PMs give engineers and designers to solve the problem, the higher likelihood that the final solution will be something customers love.

ch_9 - great product champions can come from anywhere, often in unlikely places in the organization.  seek these people out as they may have fantastic insight and ideas for successful products.

ch_10 - Some tips for managing upwards: keep emails concise, pre-meeting work is essential, and make decisions with data not others' opinions.

ch_11 - Product Opportunity assessments are excellent ways to evaluate the viability of a product. It should define things like value proposition, target market, and a go or no-go decision.

ch_12 - Product discovery is crucial to building a product that's actually useful to the customers. Focus efforts on this stage to avoid wasting money on prototypes.

ch_13 - Create a set of guiding principle for your product that declare your organization's beliefs and intentions for the finished product.

ch_14 - Establish a product council to help make decisions faster and keep the relevant parties informed as the product evolves. The council should be composed of high-ranking members from various divisions of the company.

ch_15 - Establish reference customers prior to launching your product publicly; this makes sales and marketing's job easier and creates a greater likelihood of new customers adopting the product.

ch_16 - Marketing research tools can help information and refine product decisions. But realize that you have the knowledge of what is possible at this moment to make your product special, something your customers may not be able to tell you.

ch_17 - Create various personas to represent the types of customers who will be using your product. These personas can help decide which features are worth pursuing and which are not.

ch_18 - PRDs take too long to write and usually crap. Instead, create realistic prototypes that will allow you to quickly adapt product requirements based on feedback from prototypes.

ch_19 - Prior to actually building the product, define the user experience. This helps to avoid making tradeoffs in technical implementation when user experience is being defined in parallel.

ch_20 - Don't bother creating a spec with priorities attached to each feature. Instead, define the features that meet minimal functionality and build on top of that.

ch_21 - Validate your product specs so you are confident the product will be successful through feasibility testing, usability testing, and value testing.

ch_22 - A functioning prototype helps you gain a deeper understanding of your product and also allows you to test the product against real users before committing engineers to working on the project.

ch_23 - As a PM, live and breathe metrics about your product, and use this data to drive ongoing development.

ch_24 - Be smart about deploying change so as to avoid angry users. Test changes, communicate changes, and be sensitive to feedback from users.

ch_25 - Launching the product doesn't mean your work is done. Schedule a rapid response phase immediately after launching to respond to customer feedback.

ch_26 - Using Agile is not an excuse for a lack of product planning. You should always have clear direction so that you know where you're headed and what you're trying to accomplish.

ch_27 - If using the Waterfall methodology, ensure that the requirements and design phases are all about product discovery; and, validate the product spec before moving to implementation.

ch_28 - Startups should establish clear owners for a product as soon as possible: hire a PM, an interaction designer, and a prototyper.

ch_29 - Large companies can still innovate - a great way to do so is via 20% time that lets engineers and product people work on anything they want as a 20% project.

ch_30 - "Most people wander around in the dark and bitch about it being dark, instead of learning where the light switches are." So true about operating in a large company.

ch_31 - Apple knows their shit. Their user experience serves a strong emotion, and people are willing to pay for that.

ch_32 - Don't let specific customer requirements drive your product, lest you risk confusing customer requirements with product requirements.

ch_33 - Often, the new big thing is simply a reincarnation of something old; because of new advancements, they're able to do it much faster/better/cheaper than whoever was doing it before.

ch_34 - Emotions determine the products we purchase. This makes a strong case for designing your produce very well.

ch_35 - PMs should focus on anger - identify the task that people hate the most, make it better, and you've got yourself a great product win.

ch_36 - Good design requires discipline between visual design (to make it interesting to look at) and interaction design (to make it easy to use)

ch_37 - If you're building a consumer web app, all you have is the user experience to define your produce. Do it well.

ch_38 - If you're thinking of building enterprise software, there's enormous gains to be had by simply investing in good design.

ch_39 - Platform product managers ought to consider end-users as much as the developers they're designing for.

ch_40 - Product marketing and project management are not substitutes for effective product management.

ch_41 - PMs need thinking time to remain confident about the decisions that are being made on the product.
