##Part I - People 
###Chapter 1 
*Objection: The names of roles do not matter as much as Marty Cagan wishes they would matter. 
###Chapter 2 
*proportions of titled positions are important for success, but if products are supported wrong they will fail. actually they'll fail anyway.
###Chapter 3
*Paradigms from the world of shipped software won't transfer to the web. The train model dictates different roles for project and product managers.
###Chapter 4 
*Good products require good user experience. Prototype rapidly and test usability to create usable and valuable software. 
###Chapter 5 
*engineers must observe customers in order to build a product that suits their needs, minimize churn, and manage comms effectively through multiple channels when team is remote. 
###Chapter 6 
*great Prod Mans must have a passion for building great products, empathy for the customer, a strong work ethic, and the ability to motivate teams to perform at a high level under time constraints. cannot be taught, must be innate. (I'm using TwitLonger, sue me.)
###Chapter 7
*I don't want this to sound self-serving since it is no secret that I spend a good deal of my time helping companies develop the skills of their product managers. Spoiler Alert: It was self-serving. So much objection to tone. but content basically advocates for holding Prod Mans to higher standards and coming down hard on ill-performance. 
###Chapter 8 
*General Patton, not really a product manager, but a guy with good advice. Interesting choice of gender for UX Designers (her). Users won't think of good solutions, so don't let them. 
###Chapter 9 
*a chapter in which cagan pats himself on the back. however, takeaway is: find valuable product people in all places. don't just seek out those that come to you. prod people can be hiding in any corner of your company. utilize them for greatest results. 
###Chapter 10 
*managing up is difficult because goals and insight trickle down, but those at the down must see the picture looking up. 

##Part II - Process 
###Chapter 11
*Assess opportunities based on value, market composition, strategy, and solution requirements. 
###Chapter 12
*Discovery is an organic process, but in the business environment must be forced. a good Prod Man is adaptive and allows their discovery to follow the course of schedule requirements. 
###Chapter 13
*Principles align with strategy and often times will create conflict because they are more subjective and less steeped in the physical nature of the product itself. 
###Chapter 14 
*The product council seems awfully bureaucratic for something that is meant to speed the dev process along. 
###Chapter 15
*Allow users to pilot development by offering benefits to both sides of the equation. user benefits on cost and release time. product benefits from real user input. 
###Chapter 16
*Marketing research has limitations. Be wise about the way you leverage consumer insights to inform products. 
###Chapter 17
*Envision target user and design for them (personas), this will create a clear aesthetic. 
###Chapter 18
*Product specs are often times bad and do not make efficient use of their purpose. Use High-Fidelity Prototypes.
###Chapter 19 
*UX is important so let it drive build. Praise. Amen. 
###Chapter 20 
*Streamline product features as much as possible. Product Managers should have the insight and intuition to know what is fluff and what is functional property.
###Chapter 21
*TEST ALL THE FUCKING TIME. TEST FOR VALUE AND USABILITY BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. 
###Chapter 22
*allow real users to test prototypes. i think testing in the use environment is the best bet. allows users to have a more natural experience. 
###Chapter 23
*Product Improvement is not about adding features, it's about creating meaningful change to a product and allowing for more inclusive and usable products. 
###Chapter 24
*Careful deployment improves user happiness. Bundle changes in versions so that users are not assaulted with too many releases. 
###Chapter 25 
*Keep watch on projects after deployment. Some issues don't present until live and will be discovered by users. Prioritize issues and fix them frequently or as they occur. 
###Chapter 26 
*Agile can be successful if you follow the steps in this top 10 list. Also train employees. I hate the use of Agile as a noun. 
###Chapter 27
*In Waterfall, phase dev & review synchronously. Watch the market and respond to it because change can be costly.  
###Chapter 28 
*This chapter repeats Chapter 13, but talks more about the product spec. Please see chapter 13. 
###Chapter 29
*Allow engineers to innovate on the clock. Innovation is natural for creative minds but can be stifled in large companies.  
###Chapter 30 
*large companies are risk averse, so tread gently and focus on building trust within. get things done, pick effective managers, and manage time wisely. 

##Part III - Product
###Chapter 31 
*We should all worship at Steve Jobs altar because Apple prides itself on allowing UX to guide product creation and discovery. Can definite new markets for itself. 
###Chapter 32
*Do not allow "specials" to guide development. This can cloud the product process and a good PM must be able to turn down what may be a lucrative opportunity in the name of creating a good product. 
###Chapter 33 
*As a fluid industry, areas of possibility are constantly changing and what we couldnt do yesterday, we can now do today. Allow your products to be fluid as well. 
###Chapter 34
*Users are real people with feelings and their experience is contingent on such. Allow that to inform your product and gain happier users. 
###Chapter 35
*Different users will adopt differently. Their adoption will create different emotions. An Angry adopter is not necessarily an angry user and may be the most likely to inspire change in the product. 
###Chapter 36
*Aesthetic and usability go hand in hand. Allow usability to guide the aesthetic and your design will be intuitive and inclusive. 
###Chapter 37 
*This chapter summarizes the 6 before it. Please read those summaries. ALSO DATA PROTECTION IS IMPORTANT. 
###Chapter 38
*Please see Chapter 37. Be smart about sales, and stand your ground. 
###Chapter 39
*3 types of constituents can all use thre same product but may require specifications. User interface can reflect different users but may not require different back end.
