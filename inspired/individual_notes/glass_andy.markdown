1.

Cool layout of roles.  I can tell already I am going to be irked by Marty seemingly referencing specific types of people when talking about roles

2.  

Interesting thoughts on combining prod manager and marketer. Who better to market a prod than the person who architechted it based on it's value?

3.

'What makes a good prod manager' is worth re-reading 5x.  I think it defines what makes an effective worker, too.

4.

User interaction is key to building great products.  Products that are difficult to use suck.  period.

5.

So many questions about the dichotomy of 'shitting out' a great product quickly and making a truly great product.  knowing what to say no to is key

6.

Many of these can be titled 'recruiting good workers'. I feel strongly that understanding technological capabilities is HUGE.  recognizing quick fixes and saying no to high bandwidth, poorer ideas. 

7.

How many product managers *really* control the product strategy for the company.  It seems this would realistically fall in the hands of the ceo and the VP product management would manage the product portfolio.

8.

True. Of course, if you know processes to help people more effectively work, theres nothing wrong with that, right?

9.

These were all very cool stories.  I wonder what a company like LS can do to actively comb for 'hidden talent' like this?

10.

measuring churn = genius.  Realistically, it seems hard to reduce though- what processes does Cagan suggest to do so?

11.

"I think there is a tendency in software companies to assume that the product is already about as good as it can be, and continued investment won't make much of a difference"

12.

As soon as you start the execution phase of version 1.0, begin the discovery phase of version 2.0 #greattip

13.

I'd have to guess that prioritizing product principles is much harder than Cagan is making it out to be. I.e., how do you rank security, usability, features over one another

14.

"This is not a group that designs or builds products.. its oversees the flow of products through the development process and makes the key decisions"

15.

This is an obvious win, except in the case of a struggling startup, where giving 8-10 customers free access to a product may be too risky

16.

"As useful as market research tools and techniques are, I know of no winning product that was created by market research" #BOOM

17.

Releasing a product iteration for a specific persona doesn't really seem like it would work at a consumer comp. like LS. Maybe on a feature basis, though

18.

I've never thought of the concept of a 'high-fidelity' prototype.  Sounds like an invaluable tool for spec-ing.  Great idea to put it in a wiki!

19.

" a good UX designer will want to try out dozens of ideas and approaches in a matter of days.. the thought of waiting 2-4 weeks would be debilitating"

20.

"By far the most common reason product managers request changes to the spec is a consequence of not thinking through them in the first place" #BOOM

21.

I question how realistic it is to have accurate "value testing".  Most people don't know what they want 'til you show them, so it may be rough to measure value.

22.

Great perspective on testing!  My question is which users should you target? If you are a consumer product, do you want people who are currently using?  people not comfortable with the web?

23.

Cagan has reference maybe 6x about improving the conversion funnel.  He only needed one time for it to resonate with me.

24.

Another thing that can cause user abuse is effecting user security by changing the monetization or socialization of the product.

25.

There is a typo in the book, calling this chapter '26'. I am curious about how many 'hot fixes' there are in software. ID-ing and correcting these is huge.

26.

"Using Agile is not an excuse for lack of product planning" #BOOM

27.

This was a good intro to the benefits and pitfalls of waterfall.   To me, it seems disjointed. Is there a way to bring some deliverables to an agile method?

28.

Good theories, but it's very reasonable to start with an engineering team rather than creating a high-fidelity prototype first

29.innovating  in large companies

There was no chapter 29. I love the concept of skunk works.  I think it's interesting that you can tread the line of working to help the company while subverting your managers directive.

"Every organization needs one core competance, innovation" =Peter Drucker

30. Succeeding in large companies

This seemed like a chapter on office politicing, which is annoying.  Cagan's point on learning how decisions are made is a very valuable one.

31. Lessons From Apple

"They understand the role that emtion plays in getting consumers to crave, buy and love a product"

32.

If a special serves the needs of an entire persona of customers, does it still make sense to ignore it?

33.

I've never thought to pursue usability testing on competitors products, but this would be a great way to invent the 'new old thing'

34.

"You'll find the competition you should be worrying about is not the start up...offering the same thing, but rather the offline alternative"

35.

The emotional adoption curve.  Innovators = lovers, early adopters = irrationals, early majority= efficients, late majority = laughers, laggards = comfortable.

36.

This is spot on. Usability or Asthetics alone don't make a good site.  I would expect there to be designers talented in both these fields though, as they are definately inter-related.

37.

"pay your taxes by working on scale continously from day one and dont let yourself get to the brink"

38.

Interesting thought on 'customer vs. user'.  who do you design more for?  If you are designing to save user labor, it is certainly in the customers interest.  Can these two misalign though?

39.

"Its ok for the developers to work alittle harder if the app is something end users will use... vs developers happy and noone wants the end result"

40.

"Before you jump into the solution, make sure you know what problem you're trying to solve, who you're solving for and how you'll know if you are sucessful"

41.

"Can I explain the differentiation to a corp exec in 2 min?  a smart customer in one min?  an industry analyst in 30 sec?"
