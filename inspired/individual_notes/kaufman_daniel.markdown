1) But then someone needs to take a hard look at the idea and decide if it is something worth pursuing. The product manager is responsible for this assessment.

2) The problem with combining the product manager and product marketing roles into one position is that it is very hard to find someone who can do both types of jobs well.

3) So the product generally was in the same granularity and frequency as the project, making it relatively easy for the product manager to double as the project manager. But in the Web services world, this model breaks down.

4) A good product requires a good user experience. And a good user experience requires the close collaboration of product management and user experience design.

5) As a product manager, you’ll quickly learn that if you have a good relationship with engineering, then the job can be a great one.

6) The truth is that nearly every product has features that are not really all that important—if the features were never there, it would not significantly impact the sales or customer satisfaction.

7) It is the primary job of every manager to build and develop the capabilities of his or her team, but this is especially crucial for the role of Director of Product Management because of the high-impact nature of the product management position. An inadequate product manager is almost certain to fail, resulting in wasted product cycles, frustrated users, and lost customers.

8) So the more latitude you can give your engineers and user experience designers in coming up with the solutions to the problems you are trying to solve, the more likely they will come up with something that customers will love.

9) Probably the single most important lesson I’ve learned in the product business is to start by seeking out the smartest people in the company.

10) It’s not just you and your manager who need to be on the same page, your manager’s manager—and others on up the chain—all bring their own initiatives to the table.

11) But there’s a problem with not doing anything and just jumping right into the product: it is generally a good idea to look before you leap. The challenge is to do this in a quick, lightweight, yet effective manner.

12) This is why I prefer to think of this phase as “product discovery” more than “requirements and design.”

13) Coming up with product principles means deciding what is important to you—and what is incidental—and deciding what is strategic and fundamental, and what is simply tactical and temporary.

14) This is because key product decision makers are all available with the express purpose of making those decisions the product organization needs to get products to market.

15) If at launch there are a half-dozen marquee names publicly stating their use and satisfaction with a product, then the job of the sales and marketing folks is dramatically easier, as the greatest risk the potential customer faces is dramatically reduced.

16) The result is that some product teams miss out because they don’t take advantage of the information these tools and techniques can offer. Yet other teams go astray because they depend on these techniques to answer questions the tools are incapable of answering.

17) The persona is an archetype description of an imaginary but very plausible user that personifies these traits—especially their behaviors, attitudes, and goals.

18) the benefits of having a high-fidelity representation of the product that the full product team can interact with to understand the product to be built are so great that they dwarf the incremental costs.

19) That said, one thing that many teams try to do in parallel—but should not—is user experience design and implementation.

20) First, the job of the product manager, working with his designer, is to come up with a high-fidelity prototype with the minimal functionality necessary to meet the business objectives

21) The key is to prove to yourself and to the rest of the product team that the spec you give them describes a winning product.

22) testing your ideas with real users is probably the single most important activity in your job as product manager.

23) Your job as product manager is to live and breath these metrics. Every day you should ask yourself what you can do to improve them.

24) The solution to user abuse isn’t to prevent change, it’s to be smart about deploying change.

25) I advocate that all project teams schedule a phase that begins at launch and lasts typically a few days to a week. I call this phase rapid response, to emphasize that it is all about responding quickly to what you learn once the product has been launched.

26) Using Agile is not an excuse for a lack of product planning.

27) In many ways, the Waterfall process represents an idealistic but naïve view of the software development process, where people are able to anticipate the key issues and fully understand the requirements.

28) So why don’t all startup teams do this? Because we’re such an engineering-driven industry that we just naturally start there.

29) In large organizations, it’s hard to get permission to officially explore ideas. However, once you have proven an idea, it’s remarkably easy to get the project funded.

30) “Most people wander around in the dark and bitch about it being dark, instead of learning where the light switches are.”

31) They understand better than anyone else the role that emotion plays in getting consumers to crave, buy, and love a product.

32) One of the surest ways to derail a product company is to confuse customer requirements with product requirements.

33) While it’s always fun to speculate on what the next new big thing is, much more often than not, the next big thing is not something altogether new, but rather a new incarnation of something old.

34) People buy and use products largely for emotional reasons. The best marketing people understand this, and the best product people ensure that their products speak to these emotions.

35) Because angry people dictate the future of technology.

36) I think what these two cases illustrate is that the disciplines of interaction design and visual design are very different.

37) there’s nothing between you and your customer—no sales force or distribution channels to work through.

38) I’m very sorry to say it, but most of the (enterprise) applications are just awful.

39) Many extremely successful platforms have been downright awful for the developers. But they succeeded because of compelling value to the end-users and—therefore—to the application providers. You don’t have to look further than early Windows for an example of this.

40) It is shocking to me how many product teams think they can come up with great products without talking to users and customers.

41) Is my product truly differentiated? Can I explain the differentiation to a company executive in two minutes? To a smart customer in one minute? To an industry analyst in 30 seconds?
