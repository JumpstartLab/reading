Chapter 1: Get your team in place by defining roles and responsibiities.  Easier to define for them if you understand them and what is expeceted from each role.

Chapter 2: Don't let your marketer manage your product.  Don't let your manager market your product.

Chapter 3: Project managers need to be decisive, clear thinking and create a sense of urgency.

Chapter 4: "A great product requires a good user experience.  And a good user experience requires the close collaboration of product management and user experience design."

Chapter 5: PM wants the best solution to the problem. Engineer knows what's possible, what's not and manages expectations.  "Keep the focus on the minimal product..your job as product manager is not to define the ultimate product, it's to define the smallest possible product that will meet your goals."

Chapter 6: "The product manager needs to constantly revisit assumptions about the domain and the customers.  It's not impossible for people with deep domain expertise to do this, but they have to work harder at it to remain open-minded to new developments and options."

Chapter 7: He argues that in some places in the company it's okay to have sub-par employees because others will pick up the slack, but it's not okay in the area of Product Managers.  I think this is an honest oppinion, and probably very realistic, but I would say that if you know you have someone sub-par, you should cut them as soon as you can.

Chapter 8: “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”

Chapter 9: Open your eyes, ears and mind.  Ask people what they think and who the great minds are.  They will probably be a lot more than you imagined.

Chapter 10: Offer suggestions on how to solve problems, don't just raise issues.

CHapter 11: I think what’s really going on is that there is a tendency in software companies to assume that the product is already about as good as it can be, and continued investment won’t make much of a difference.

Chapter 12: It doesn’t help to talk to users, create prototypes, and test with users, if you don’t adjust your course based on what you learn.

Chapter 13: For virtually all product decisions, the key is to properly frame the decision to be made, and to first get everyone on the same page in terms of: What problem exactly are you trying to solve? Who exactly are you trying to solve this problem for—which persona? What are the goals you are trying to satisfy with this product? What is the relative priority of each goal?


Chapter 14: Adding more hierarchy?  Product council sounds good and bad.  Good that there is a definite place to go to get decisions made, but bad because seems like it takes away some of hte autonomy of the PM and rest of the team.

Chapter 15: Talk to customers.  Find out if you are solving their problems.  Get them on record to do some marketing for you.  If you can't find customers to do this, they you're doing it wrong.

Chapter 16: Use data, but don't rely on it to do the work for you.

Chapter 17: Put on your persona hat early and often.  It'll help get the right product to the right people.

Chapter 18: peace out product spec, hello prototype.

Chapter 19: "This is one situation where sequential is important. The requirements and design happen together, and then implementation and test can happen together."

Chapter 20: Keep it simple.  Pare it down until the user would not be able to use the product.  Then you'll not have to make as many hard decisions on what to cut out.

Chapter 21: Prototypes offer a lot of help in figuring out what will work, but sometimes management misses the point and forces the prototype into the final product because it's already been made already.

Chapter 22: In testing, make sure you get the testers to give honest opinion on the product for basic tasks.  Don't ask for critiques, just ask for notes on usability.

Chapter 23: "product organizations are essentially feature factories (with some bug fixing thrown in). For them it is all about adding features."  "Remember that it’s not about what a particular customer thinks is important to add, or the result of a survey, or a focus group. What matters is what actually moves the needle on the metrics you are driving towards."

Chapter 24: People dislike change.  Make sure you change for a good reason, rather than just to break shit and make people mad. Also let them know it's coming and offer solutions on how to prepare/learn the changes.

Chapter 25: "enterprise software, I like to send members of the product team—product manager, engineers, designers—out to the customer site to be there with them when they install the software and work to get the software live and in use. It is amazing how much faster issues are identified and resolved when a team member understands she’s going to be at the customer site until the customer is live and referenceable."

Chapter 26: Don't hate. Iterate.  Don't get too attached to your implementation as it will keep you from listening to customers and delivering the best product to suit their needs.

Chapter 27: Waterfall is wack.  Scrum yourself.

Chapter 28: "But any startup has to realize that everything starts with the right product, so the first order of business is to figure out what that is before burning through $500K or more in seed funding."  Prototype your pants off, get it in front of customers asap, then hire your engineering team to implement it.

Chapter 29: Millions of ways to get innovation flowing.  Lots of times it's hard to get there, but it's worth the effort in the end.  Keep your nose to the grind stone and it will be good.

Chapter 30: Embrace the culture you are working in.  If you try to change it or fight it, you won't get anywhere.

Chapter 31: Emotions of users is a lot more powerful than people realize.  Apple has this down pat.

Chapter 32: "it is natural for any customer to want to describe their problem in terms of the solution they can envision rather than the underlying problem itself."  "While I am all for tools that help people do their jobs better, the problem is that, while these tools are well intentioned, they make it extremely easy to fall into the trap of confusing customer requirements with product requirements."

Chapter 33: "as long as there are products that drive you nuts, there are opportunities for someone to do it better."

Chapter 34: "In many cases you’ll find that the competition you should be worrying about is not the startup or big portal that’s after the same thing you are, but rather the offline alternative."  Keep in mind that they don't have to do it online, if you make it easier and better, they will use your product.

Chapter 35: "I like my product managers to focus on the most miserable thing people have to deal with everyday. If you can solve that problem, that actually changes behavior, and that can lead to the truly big product wins."  Love this idea of focus on problems that cause pain, and you'll get the consumers on your side.

Chapter 36: "more products I see, the stronger I believe in (a) the role that emotion plays in inspiring products, and (b) the direct role visual design plays in creating that emotion."

Chapter 37: This guy loves top ten lists to recap his previous chapters.

Chapter 38: Enterprise software is largely a giant turd.  If you can revamp it and treat it like a consumer product, you'll most likely get tons of users.

Chapter 39: End user is the most important.  Make your developers work a little harder if the end user will be happier.

Chapter 40: Glad I didn't, but could have skipped to this chapter for a printable version of what to do.

Chapter 41: Second printable worry list.  Will keep these in mind as I'm creating my new products.  Sure fire wins for me and LivingSocial.
