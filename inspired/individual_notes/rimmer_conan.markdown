## CHAPTER 1

PM - assess product opps. & define product to be built.  The team also needs Eng., UX Designer, Site Ops, Marketing & PjM.

## CHAPTER 2

> "The [PM]  is responsible for defining ... the product to be built... The product marketing person is responsible for telling the world about that product"

## CHAPTER 3

PM != PjM.  PM owns the product.  PjM owns the schedule.

## CHAPTER 4

> "a good user experience requires the close collaboration of product management and user experience design."

## CHAPTER 5

> "The [PM] is responsible for defining the solution, but the engineering team knows best what’s possible, and they must ultimately deliver that solution."

## CHAPTER 6

For PMs, look for product passion, customer empathy, intelligence, work ethic, integrity, confidence, and the right attitude.

## CHAPTER 7

As Manager of Prod Mgrs., hire the best; take the lead on product definition; efficiently focus on happy customers.

## CHAPTER 8:

A product manager that values UX, who is in a company that values UX, and trusts his UX Designer has a big advantage in coming up with winning products.

## CHAPTER 9:

"Deputy Product Managers" = non-PM colleagues with great product acumen.  Find them & learn new ways to make your company's products great.

## CHAPTER 10:

Everyone, from CEO down, needs to head in the same gen. direction.  Communicate effectively.  Post your issues with possible solutions.  Be low maintenance.

## CHAPTER 11:

For your product, know: value prop.; target market & size; success metrics; competition; your differentiator; market window, go-to-market strat.; solution reqs.

## CHAPTER 12:

When defining the right product, figure out what to build in 1.0 first.  Then, while building 1.0, begin defining 2.0.

## CHAPTER 13:

> "Coming up with product principles means deciding ... what is strategic and fundamental, and what is simply tactical and temporary."

## CHAPTER 14:

The Product Council, a cross-functional set of managers, sets the strategic product direction & oversees product efforts.

## CHAPTER 15:

Recruit target customers for Charter User Programs to get continuous, valuable feedback on your product from the people it's meant to serve.

## CHAPTER 16:

Market Research provides you with data on what has been built & what users may want built.  This helps Prod determine what to build.

## CHAPTER 17:

Understand the target user by adopting a persona, giving you an idea of who your product is for & for prioritizing what's important.

## CHAPTER 18:

For good product specs, accurately describe full user experiences & how the software behaves in terms of user interactions & visual design.

## CHAPTER 19:

Define the UX before building the product.  It's harder to change UX mid-flight & defining it first helps answer hard questions earlier.

## CHAPTER 20:

Focus on only what's important & define a minimal product using validated prototypes.  That way, only what is necessary is being built.

## CHAPTER 21:

Validation tests provide evidence that your product is feasible to build, usable, & valuable to customers; i.e., will be successful.

## CHAPTER 22:

Observe an end-user sample using prototypes to accomplish key tasks to find out if your product ideas will work for real users.

## CHAPTER 23:

Use (ideally objective, not subjective) metrics to define crucial improvements for existing products.

## CHAPTER 24:

> The solution to user abuse isn’t to prevent change, it’s to be smart about deploying change.

## CHAPTER 25:

Don't quickly shift focus right after launching.  Quickly identify live issues, "hot fix", post issue alerts, & otherwise quickly respond.

## CHAPTER 26:

In Agile: interact often; replace heavy specs with prototypes & user stories; break work into small, ind. chunks; examine sprint results.

## CHAPTER 27:

To succeed at Waterfall, minimize change by identifying & resolving process issues ASAP.  The later the change, the more costly it is.

## CHAPTER 28:

Startup Product Management = come up with ideas, create & validate using prototypes, rinse, repeat.

## CHAPTER 29:

> The two biggest factors influencing your ability to innovate in a large are your corporate culture and your manager.

## CHAPTER 30:

> “Most people wander around in the dark and bitch about it being dark, instead of learning where the light switches are.”

## CHAPTER 31:

The Apple way: The Hardware Serves the Software; The Software Serves the User Experience; The User Experience Serves the Emotion.

## CHAPTER 32:

"A special is when a company gets a big check from a [customer] [so] that you build into your product exactly what they say."  Don't do this ever.

## CHAPTER 33:

Emerging techs may allow you to do new things with your existing product.   Reassess what is possible at regular intervals.

## CHAPTER 34:

> In the enterprise space, the dominant emotion is generally fear or greed.  In the consumer space, the dominant emotions get more personal.

## CHAPTER 35:

> "What are the emotions that are driving the behavior?” And then we look for ways to tap into those emotion with features and all the other things."

## CHAPTER 36:

> "You can show the exact same functionality to a user—one with wireframes and one with a good visual design—and the overall response can be dramatically different."

## CHAPTER 37 - 41
