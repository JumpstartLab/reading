### Deep Thoughts, by Jonan Scheffler

* Chapter 1
There are, however, several very important considerations for Agile teams when it
comes to product organizations, such as incorporating user experience design,
* Chapter 2
The product manager is responsible for defining—in detail—the product to be built,
and validating that product with real customers and users.
* Chapter 3
There are so many reasons for aimless, unconstructive meetings, but one of the
biggest culprits is that it’s not always clear to the participants exactly
what the purpose of the meeting is, what problem is to be solved, and what the
specific issues or obstacles are.
* Chapter 4
The user experience of the product is simply too core to the company to not have
in-house.
* Chapter 5
With all this in mind, I always try to encourage the best engineers to come try 
their hand at product management. - Why shouldn't all product managers have
engineering backgrounds?
* Chapter 6
The product manager is the person ultimately held accountable for the success of 
the product, and this burden weighs heavily on the successful product manager. -
Why isn't the entire organization held accountable for a product's success?

There are many people that want to be able to work 40 hours a week and—most
importantly—leave their work problems at the office when they go home at the
of the day. This unfortunately is not the life of a successful product manager.

Confidence is a critical ingredient, and people are more likely to follow a
leader who has it, rather than one who does not. - I am dumber for having read
this.

I have known too many product managers who burn themselves out with 70-hour
workweeks, but the worst part is when I tell them that they’re not actually
doing their job. - Pairs nicely with "40 hours is not enough."

I sometimes talk of product managers needing to be bilingual. Not in Chinese and
English. They need to be able to converse equally well with engineers about
technology as they do with executives and marketers about cost structures,
margins, market share, positioning, and brand. - Communication skills are not
optional.

People that have spent a long time building their mastery of one domain often
fall into another common product management trap: they believe they can speak
for the target customer,
* Chapter 7
Your only real hope if the product manager isn’t fully capable is that someone
else on the product team—perhaps a lead engineer—steps up to do what’s
necessary. - I expect that product roles will increasingly be filled by
engineers.

If you empower strong people and let them do their jobs, I promise you that you’ll
be amazed at what they can do. Note that you’ve first got to make sure you have
strong people.

Net Promoter Score (NPS). It’s a very simple metric, and you can read all about
it at www.netpromoter.com. - There has to be a better way to calculate this
(although revenue seems a nice metric as well).
* Chapter 8
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you
with their ingenuity.” - General George S. Patton, Jr.
* Chapter 9
They think that they are the ones that must always come up with the big ideas,
and that if someone else did, what would their purpose be? - Don't let product
managers become failures with their failed ideas.
* Chapter 10
Measure and plan for churn. - Why not develop an entire system around it?
* Chapter 11
But unless they change the way they produce that new product, they’re likely
going to end up with yet another under-performing product in need of
improvement.
* Chapter 12
Churn is a natural part of product development. Why can't the product be
malleable. Most successful companies build software they didn't plan from the
beginning.
* Chapter 13
For virtually all product decisions, the key is to properly frame the decision
to be made, and to first get everyone on the same page in terms of: What problem
exactly are you trying to solve? Who exactly are you trying to solve this
problem for—which persona? What are the goals you are trying to satisfy with
this product? What is the relative priority of each goal?
* Chapter 14
Milestone 3: Review product prototypes, user testing results and detailed cost estimates,
and issue go/no-go decision to begin engineering. - Do at least this
* Chapter 15
All that input is fine, but it is in no way a substitute for the product manager
getting the direct interaction with users he needs to do his job.
* Chapter 16
Winning products come from the deep understanding of the user’s needs combined with an
equally deep understanding of what’s just now possible.
* Chapter 17
One of the most common mistakes product teams make is confusing themselves with
their customers. One thing I really like about personas is that they help shine
a light on this all too prevalent problem.
* Chapter 18
The product spec is obsolete. There is no need to update it.
* Chapter 19
Why can't we define the UX as we build?
* Chapter 20
MVPs should be about two steps beyond the prototype, imho.
