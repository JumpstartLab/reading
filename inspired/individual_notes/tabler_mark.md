Ch1: One visual designer to 4 interaction designers to 8 product managers to 80 engineers.  So even with the size of the LS engineering team we should only have 2 visual designers?

2: 9 of 10 product releases are failures; either not valuable or not usable.

3.  If a project manager has to overcome hundreds of "very valid" reasons why a product is not ready to ship, how do you keep from releasing things that are not in fact ready to ship?

4.  There is no way one visual designer, by the definition in this chapter, could support 8 different product managers each with their own product.  They'd be backlogged inside of twenty minutes.

5.  I can definitely support getting engineers in front of users and customers; I've seen a lot of ivory-tower situations this could avoid. I like the "headroom" idea. Chap 5 seems especially relevant to our situation.

6.  Isn't a hard-working, smart, customer-focused person pretty much the definition of "good employee"?

7.  I don't like NPS.  It's good in theory, but I don't think customers put nearly as much thought into their score as the people who chart the course of entire businesses put into reading it.

8.  Saying that General Patton would have been quite a project manager is as distractingly insulting as saying that FDR would have made an excellent Tupperware Party host.

9.  Perhaps I'm lucky to work for LS, but I don't see anybody with a good idea getting overlooked because they have the wrong job title, gender, or skin color.

10.  I don't like how he keeps referring to people as "tools" or "resources" that can be "used". It makes me want to reject most of the rest of what he's saying because I don't want any part of that mindset.

11.  I really like the idea of getting answers from Finance.  I always tend to assume I'm not "allowed" to know how our company makes money, but I'm starting to realize I can't be 100% effective unless I do.

12.  Building the wrong product is worse than building nothing at all, and both problems can be avoided by paying attention to building the right thing.

13.  Decide who your product is for, what problems of theirs you're trying to solve, and then how you're going to solve them.

14.  A Product Council sounds like an excellent way to throw all of your agility over Niagara Falls in a barrel.

15.  Charter Users sound like a solution for B2B concerns.  I can't see Netflix or LS doing Charter Users.

16.  I don't know if I'm just marketing-jaded, but isn't the best way to market-research a product to prototype it and see whether it takes off?

17.  I like the thought of giving types of users names, that we can then talk about as if they were real people.  "Sam wouldn't like this layout; Mary wants more colors."  Seems easier to develop relevant features.

18.  High-Fidelity Prototypes are *so* the right way to spec software development that everything else feels like a "meh, close enough" compromise.

19.  It seems obvious to me that UX needs to be closely coupled to feature design, but maybe that's not obvious to people specialized in other disciplines.

20.  The idea touched on here about an engineer being involved in the MVP discussion is critical.  Amazing how many opportunities are lost because someone assumes a thing is harder or easier than it is.

21.  I can't help but think of my old boss, whose idea of usability testing was to have a collection of five eight-year-olds tell her what they wanted out of the site after 30 mins testing - and then we'd all build that and wonder why it flopped.

22.  Is user testing really this complicated?  Shouldn't I just be able to watch someone try to complete X task on my website, and watch what problems they run into (if any) while they do it?

23.  Refinement of existing features is often as valuable, or more valuable, than simply bolting on new features.

24.  Remember that your users may not appreciate the change necessary to actually get to a new version (think New Coke).

25.  You're not done with the launch until after you receive and incorporate feedback, so don't go sending the team off to new ventures just yet.

26.  "Wait months for one or more sprint cycles" - I have *never* heard of a sprint cycle lasting longer than 2 weeks.  What is he talking about?

27.  Isn't "succeeding with waterfall processes" an oxymoron, especially in Internet software development?

28.  This sounds like it yields the "I have a billion dollar website idea, now I just need someone to build it" crapola that's polluting the Craigslist boards today.

29.  Just thinking about "Skunk Works" projects gets me excited.  Even if I don't have 20% time or something similar, I think I could "surprise and delight" someone with a top-secret tool project.

30.  Prototypes are far more valuable than powerpoints.  In other words:  Either do it, and shut up; or don't do it, and shut up.

31.  How your user feels about an experience matters at least as much as the objective, logical benefits they get out of it.  Probably more so.

32.  "Specials" essentially lock your company into following someone else's product directions.

33.  I think that a cell phone that doesn't drop calls is impossible, and my first reaction is to explain the limitations of the technology.  But then, I remember I had the same initial thoughts about "good" search results, solid speech recognition, and glasses-free 3d.

34.  I agree that products need to satisfy emotional needs - but are we talking about the range of human wants, or the seven deadly sins?  Remarkably negative focus in this chapter.

35.  We've got TDD, BDD, EDD, and 404DD.  Now, we can add Anger Driven Development to the mix.  I think I like it.

36.  Can't just work right, can't just feel right - has to *look* right, too, even when I'm not interacting with it.

37.  The term viral marketing is such crap.  If it goes viral, it ain't marketing.  Aspire instead for Viral Awesomeness, and you won't have to think "marketing" at all.

38.  If you need this book to tell you that your product needs to work, go and pick your brain up from the dry cleaners and try life again.

39.  I took this principle for granted, but the Java Applet / Flash example was poignant.  As a developer, I'd rather work hard than ask my user to work hard - I'd be embarrassed to deliver a Java applet these days just because they're ugly and clunky.

40.  This has been another book that felt like the author was trying to stretch a core idea across too many pages.  The fact that "consider user experience", "get charter users", "consider who your users are," "give your target users prototypes", and "measure user feedback" comprise five separate points on this ten point list strongly reinforce that suspicion.

41.  The terms "constantly obsessed" and "worry list" make me think that the author is doing something fundamentally wrong.  Making killer products shouldn't be this nail-biting, ulcer-forming experience.  Make tight cycles of MVPs, release them frequently, and reinvest your time in the ones that are taking off - and don't be afraid to kill off the ones that are not.
