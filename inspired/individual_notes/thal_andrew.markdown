## As you read, please collect one tweet worth of text on each chapter such as:
* A memorable quote
* A question yet unanswered
* The central premise
* A new idea or connection it triggered for you



1.
  Product and marketing are very separate at LivingSocial. After hearing his description that seems to be a mistake.

2.
  There is a double edged sword with setting up product management/marketing. Ownership vs time/expertise.

3.
  Good project managers keep everyone on track, focused, and driven. That role is ongoing with constant releases in web applications.

4.
  Why should rapid prototyping be VERY different from production-level coding? Can't it be a base stepping stone for it?

5.
  How do you get devs to put down the computer and show up to usability tests? I like 20% for refactoring. Does LS do that?

6.
  As I'm reading this chapter I keep thinking about Steve Rice (merchant product manager). He embodies every one of these.

7.
  I had no idea NPS was or could be used to measure a specific product manager's performance. Seems to be incomplete but helpful.

8.
  Tell the experts what you want done, not how, then you will get a better product.

9.
  The author implied that product is more prestigious/desirable than being a systems engineer. I haven't heard that before.

10.
  "If we're going to make this decision based on opinion, we're going to use my opinion."

11.
  Make friends in finance. They can help you understand and make decisions about your product. I wonder how much we do that at LS.

12.
 If you start thinking about the next iteration before the current one is finished, it might be hard not to create churn on 1.0.

13.
  It's more efficient to have engineers "play foosball" rather than work on a product that will fail.

14.
  Have a small committee from multiple areas to decide on products. Use work estimates to help make decisions.

15.
  I wonder how companies like apple and google test surprise products with potential customers. I feel like things would leak.

16.
  "Winning products come from the deep understanding of the user’s needs combined with an equally deep understanding of what’s just now possible."

17.
  Make each feature/release to please one target persona. Trying to please too many people with one feature will make it fail.

18.
  I wonder if making a hi-fi prototype with a fake back-end will work for our projects. Might be interesting to try to develop front end first.

19.
  User experience design should be done before things are built so that the design is not made worse by the pressure to create something.

20.
  Keep things simple, work towards minimum requirements for a product to get the job done. Use prototypes to help trim requirements.

21.
  It's important to make sure that you are making the right product before you start making it. Prototyping can help.

22.
  In a usability test, you only have one shot and you really have to learn as much as you can from the user. Don't blow it.

23.
  When trying to improve an existing product, focus on results and metrics, not feelings and opinions.

24.
  Make changes slowly and let people know that you are making changes. Give them the opportunity to opt in/out.

25.
  Integrate a rapid response cycle immediately after your release to deal with unforseen issues.

26.
  I want to have daily meetings/scrums when I'm working on a product. Seems like that might not happen here.

27.
  Waterfall seems archaic and unrealistic, requiring people to accurately predict potential problems too early.

28.
  With the prototype-first approach, you might have to be more careful so as to not have devs steal the idea.

29.
  Keep innovating. Come up with ideas on the side and just do them, it might work out.

30.
  Good advice on how to "play the game": make friends before you need them, pick your battles. Make stuff on your own.

31.
  Apple is so successful because it prioritizes the user and how the user feels about the product.

32.
  When is it ok to do special requests? At what point do you need to sacrifice potential long term gain for profitability?

33.
  The next big thing is usually just something that is out, but better with just avaialble technology.

34.
  Figure out the emotional needs of your consumer and make a product that fills those needs.

35.
  When you make a product, make something to relieve people's freshman emotions. That is what will succeed.

36.
  If you have to choose between good interaction design and good visual design, which do you choose?

37.
  The game changes as you get a larger userbase. Try to anticipate the different needs.

38.
  The principles for enterprise products seem to be similar to with users, just have to know the different audience.

39.
  When creating a platform, focus on end users FIRST, and it's ok for devs to work a little harder at first.

40.
  These 10 items seem to sum up the book pretty well. Can we pass them around LivingSocial?

41.
  Spend time thinking about the important questions so that you can stay on track.
