1) Defines the roles of a successful team: product mnger, engineers, marketer, dev ops, UI/UX, and visual designer. Ratio of all varies

2) Don't merge product managers and product marketers into one role. Each has a unique n varied skill set. Combining them doesn't scale

3) PRODUCT mgmt is about discovering a valuable, usable, n feasible product where as PROJECT mgmt is about executing that product.

4) Design is IMPORTANT. Interaction n visual design, rapid prototyping, n usability testing are key n should have be in house if possible.

5) Product mgmt and engineers need to be on the same page n view each other as equals. Outsourcing should b done 4 talent not cost savings

6) Great product mnger is as rare as a great product. Look 4 passion, comm skill, empathy, n innate intelligence. Disregard age n domain exp

7) The ideal company org chart should include a spot for product mgmt where the CPO is an exec position. Dont mix w/ mkt or enginering dept.

8) Give your engineers and UI/UX designers room to solve the problems you have outline. Let them be creative w/ their solutions.

9) Great product ppl can be found in all levels of ur org. Start by asking others who the smartest ppl r in the company n u'll be surprised

10) Managing mngers is hard. Get everyone on the same pg thru quick meetings n short emails. Require data n recs to problems not opinions

11) Ask these questions when determining a product's viability. And make a friend in fin dept, they have valuable data

12) Product discovery is not linear nor set in stone. Scheduling must be flexible n u must actually adjust to the customer's feedback.

13) Create a list of guiding principles that define ur product. Prioritize needs based off of ur principles and get everybody in agreement.

14) Product Councils r designed to set direction, resources, n oversight for a product. They r composed of the VP's of all necessary depts

15) While building, have a group of 6-10 customers you work w/ so when u launch u can use them as references, which makes sales much easier

16) Use mkting research tools to better understand ur different customers - Don't use to have them suggest the product u should build.

17) Create personas as earlier as possible. Each release cycle should focus on a specific persona. They r not a sub 4 real contact w/ users

18) Forget product specs, create high fidelity prototypes that convey all major use cases. Time to mkt will decrease n clarity will increase

19) Create the user experience before implementation. Sequence matters. Have engineers review design thru out to approve feasibility.

20) Build a high fidelity MVP prototype before handing it off to the engineering team.

21) Products need to undergo feasibility, usability, and value testing before engineering begins. Again, prototype first!!!

22) User testing should b done early n often. Dont lead the user w/ Qs n As. Parrot responses back n follow their body language. Take notes

23) When improving a product, don't just create more features. Learn the metrics that are important n A/B test against controlled changes

24) When changing a product, deploy gently. Users hate change. Give ample notice, make it backwards compatible, n try it regionally first

25) Extend the product and its resources to include a week after the official launch to allow for fixes based off user's experience

26) Agile developed from custom software shops where projects r smaller. If using on a large scale be sure to have product mger w/ UI/UX

27) Waterfall development...just don't do. Working code happens too late and is too costly to change based off user input.

28) Startups should 1st create a high fidelity prototype that mimics all essential functionality, test, refactor..repeat then code it.

29) Innovation can happen at big companies. Give builders 20% to work on whatever, or, if not an option, pursue in a skunk work style

31) Large companies r risk adverse. To get ur product started u need to pick ur battles, kno the decision makers, n build internal support

32) Apple builds everything from a user exp perspective, from its software to its supporting hardware.

33) Building specs around specific customers can be damaging to long term goals. They hinder speed and can conflict w/ ur own objectives

33) New ideas don't need to come from creating completely new mkts, but by making an old product better.

34) In consumer apps, ppl have a driving emotion for using ur product, make ur UI/UX reflect those emotions

35) We r driven by our emotions. Build stuff that alleviates what makes us angry, sad, scared, lonely, jaded etc...

36) Both visual and interactive design are important aspects of consumer internet products. Dont discount their role in inspiring emotion

37) Large scale products need to take user exp, scale, availability, support, community mgmt, n gentle deployment to heart to be successful

38) Enterprise software is just plain bad and needs to learn from consumer internet products. Easy to install, setup, use, and maintain

39) Platform products need to satisfy 3 custs: app providers, devs, n end users. More focus needs to shift to end user over dev happiness
