Chapter 3
7 skills that characterize great project managers: sense of urgency, framers, clear thinking, data driven, decisiveness, judgment, attitude

Chapter 4
You can get away with outsourcing some of the user experience design, but you can't outsource the interaction designer role, aka the person that knows your customers.

Chapter 5
Allocate 20% of your bandwidth to rewrites; if you neglect this, then engineers will likely ask for total rewrites which has proven to be disastrous

Chapter 6
A great product manager will have integrity, confidence, the right attitude and skills; he will know how to apply technology, have focus, have good time management skills; lastly, he will have good communication skills and will have the right blend between business and engineering skills.

Chapter 7
Net promoter scores, which are calculated as promoters less detractors, could be a good way to measure product manager performance.

Chapter 8
The more latitude you can give your engineers and user experience designers in coming up with the solutions to the problems you are trying to solve, the more likely they will come up with something that customers will love.

Chapter 9
Great minds are scattered in a company, but once found, can offer profound and insightful advice on how to make your products better.

Chapter 10
Managing your manager is possible but you need to be able to present the facts, separate out your opinions, and learn when you should pull them in for extra firepower.

Chapter 11
Sometimes the solution isn't to build a new product, it's to redesign the old.  Fix the checkout process or re-engineer the design of the website.

Chapter 12
As a product manager, make sure there is a shift in thinking between discovery and execution. Additional discovery late in the game can be disruptive to the release.

Chapter 13
A good set of product principles serves as the basis or foundation for inspiring product features.

Chapter 14
Preliminary cost estimates of small, medium, or large should be made at opportunity assessment time, followed by a detailed estimate that accompanies the final product spec.

Chapter 15
A charter user program is a program to find six users that will be your evangelists and help you identify kinks in the initial stages. It is a great way to get a deep insight into target customers and have a set of great reference customers by launch time.

Chapter 16
Focus groups can be bad because you might get skewed representation influenced by the most articulate or vocal attendees. Additionally, it is hard to get useful data about a product idea unless customers can actually interact with the product.

Chapter 17
Creating a persona of your target user can be helpful for determining which features should be included in which releases. Releases should be geared toward a specific persona so that you don't try to please everyone and end up pleasing no one.

Chapter 18
Instead of massive specs, consider building a high-fidelity prototype. High-fidelity prototypes often speed up the engineering process because it removes almost all ambiguity on how the product behaves.

Chapter 19
User experience design and implementation have to happen sequentially. If they are forced to run in parallel, disastrous results ensue.

Chapter 20
Have engineers in the design process so they can help the product manager and designer understand the relative costs of the various product ideas and stop dangerous situations early.

Chapter 21
Validate ideas through feasibility, usability, and value testing in order to figure out if an idea is worth pursuing before handing the spec over to the engineering team.

Chapter 22
During user testing, keep your users out of "critique mode." Misguided testers will ask for the user's opinion, but unless the user is an interaction designer, it shouldn't matter. If users knew what they really wanted, software would be a lot easier to create.

Chapter 23
When you're trying to improve an existing product, don't gather subjective feedback and chase features. Instead, focus on relentlessly pursuing your metrics by studying live use and working the numbers in the right direction.

Chapter 24
Be sensitive to change. User's need the opportunity to learn the differences in versions when they have time. Prepare for backlash if you give no warning before a major release.

Chapter 25
With every release comes issues. What is important is how quickly you can address these issues. Make sure to set up a rapid response period after a release to help fix these outstanding issues.

Chapter 26
In an Agile team, let engineering break up springs into whatever granularity they prefer. Functionality in a prototype might be finished in one sprint or many.

Chapter 27
The three main concerns with the waterfall approach is as follows: validation occurs too late in the process, changes are costly and disruptive, and it's hard to respond to the market.

Chapter 28
The typical startup approach of hiring an engineer building a prototype over the course of 6 months is flawed. Get a design team in place to turn out many version of the prototype in order to discover the winning product.

Chapter 29
Innovation can be generated through non traditional routes: 20% rule, skunk works, observation, user experience, acquisition

Chapter 30
Big companies are typically risk averse because they have the most to lose. Tailor the right approach to getting your tasks accomplished. "Most people wander around in the dark and bitch about it being dark, instead of learning where the light switches are."

Chapter 31
Connect your product to an emotion so that it can't be compared to other products of its class.

Chapter 32
Specials are dangerous because your job is to meet the needs of a broad range of customers. This is the only thing separating you from a custom software shop.

Chapter 33
Doing something big could simply mean refactoring old software or making previous products even better than they are currently.

Chapter 34
People buy and use products largely for emotional reasons. Enterprise purchases are based on fear and greed. Consumer purchases are based on personal emotions. Your real competition is someone that might be able to replicate the same emotion that customers get while using your software.

Chapter 35
Irrationals can teach you the value of your product all the way down the line because their emotions are magnified vs. the other groups of people.

Chapter 36
Sites need to be both usable as well as appealing. Companies need both user experience designers as well as interaction designers. It's difficult to find a person who can do both and even harder to find a product manager to fill these design roles.

Chapter 37
Usability is key and the number one thing to focus on. If the user experience is bad, no one is going to use your product. There is no single user. You have at least several important types of users, so consider each of their motivations for using your product.
