### Horace notes for Inspired by Marty Cagan

1: Product manager should be a distinct role focused on assessing product opportunities and defining/focusing the product to be built.


2. Despite business pressures, it's important that product management be segmented from product marketing because these actually involve different focuses and roles.


3. Product managers need to be decisive and focused individuals who can keep the big picture always in mind while also beind driven by data and metrics.


4. be wary of trying to combine "design" roles with other responsibilities; in a good product, design and UX are part of implementation, along with eng.


5. Engineers shouldn't be de facto responsible for product management (as sometimes happens), but they should be involved from early on


6. Good PM's need to have empathy for their potential customer - they have to rep the customer's interests on the team.


7. Like everything, metrics exist for tracking happiness of a project: NPS = how happy people are with your stuff. It matters. Go figure.


8. PM is an area where the separation of intent from implementation becomes crucial; when managing design & eng teams, independence is crucial


9. It's important to remember that PM talent can come from any field, so many organizations draw smart emps from all depts to product dept.


10. The PM requires everyone's time, so they must be extra sensitive to keep emails, meetings, workflow, etc. as streamlined as possible.


11. Traditionally Prods were def'd from business side based on marketing info; Great products need to come from a more empathetic and inspired direction


12. A neat idea is to dev mult. prod versions in parallel - 1.0 is production release while 2.0 is beta/dev, so new features go into 2.0 (helps things stay urgent/fast-paced)


13. Clearly deffing product principles at the outset will minimize indecision & make tough calls easier during product dev process


14. Product-councils are meant to relieve some bureaucratic burden but they seem awfully bureaucratic in their own right. thoughts?


15. Using a select group of "charter customers" is a good way to get user feedback during dev/design without letting the product become "custom"


16. Market research is a tool but not THE tool; it should show where customers feel pain, but not allow them to dictate the product


17. Personas inject an element of "role-play" into the dev process, making it easier for team members to empathize with customers who may be very differnt from themselves.


18. Prototypes are the new spec - -why is this not obvious? Get going ASAP on something that resembles the real prodcut and you will be less likely to fail. 


19. Design takes time, and you subordinate it to eng at your own risk; try tyo structure project timeline to keep designers ahead of engineers & keep everyone happy,.


20. "It's not enough to just believe the product definition is good, you have to test to make sure." -- product concept should be tested just like code should be


21. Other aspects of testing product concept include Feasibility, Usability, Value -- by staying on top of these early you are less likely to get surprised down the road.


22. Again, USE PROTOTYPEs - it gives you a better spec to build from AND something to test with live users. This feedback is invaluable


23. Improving prods is imp -- in context of new tech development, sometimes it will become possible to add new features no previously feasible


24. New deployments should follow a permissive "opt-in" process to let users ease in on their own time; no more traumatic patch tuesdays


25. If you can discipline your org. to give "rapid-response" after release, you will make great strides, as this is the time everything is fresh in the team's mind (big-scale context-switch)


26. Agile requires adaptation - specifically many ppl may have to work faster than comfortable, but this is the point; move fast and make progress.


27. Waterfall can actually woafjsdfgasdjkgbsaklgbasdlkjbvasdkljvbsadlkjvbadslkjvbasvjbklsadvlk


28. Startups would be wise to invest more upfront in discover rather than diving straight into engineering; this makes for better products for less money


29. Structures like 20% time and skunk/under-the-radar development can make innovation possible in large companies; this still sounds like it sucsk tho.


30. Big companies are apparently about peiople and politics. work those connections and get people to do what you want.


31. LONG LIVE THE APPLE. PRAISE THEM WITH GREAT PRAISE. You may now commence the circlejerk.


32. Be careful when big cos. come and ask you to make things for them. A lot of money from one place is cool but a little money from a lot of places is better.


33. Tech is an expanding frontier; to do well you don't have to have a new idea, just an idea that is newly possible.


34. Emotions drive our experience with products; this is difficult since most engineers are emotional husks. Seriously we should think more about art.


35. There are waves of product adopters with diff. emotional signatures attached. Focus on the Irrationals because the will teach you about your market


36. Usability = Synthetic experience & Aesthetic = Visual experience; different concepts but both are essential to creating a quality emotional experience for users.


37. Consumer web products are a different beast in that the emotional experience of using the product is EVERYTHING. Make people feel good to use ur stuff. 


38. Enterprise still needs usability (though many don't), but issues of functionality will still be primary.


39. Building platforms are cool if you do it legit, but most are posers so whatever #whyareyoustillwritingmartycagan


40. Making products is about offering a functional and emotionally stimulating experience to users; your practices should always be in service of this goal.
