#Inspired Chapter Notes

It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build.

The product manager has two key responsibilities: assessing product opportunities, and defining the product to be built.

I have long argued that the root cause of wasted releases can most often be traced to poor definition of the role of the product manager in a company and inadequate training of the people chosen for this role. 

The product manager is responsible for defining -in detail- the product to be built and validating that product with real customers and users.

Regardless of the title or organizational model... behind every great product you will find an individual who is responsible for the definition of that product.

Get your engineers in front of users and customers. Not only will they learn a great deal from seeing users struggle first hand, but they will get a better appreciation for the issues and their severity.

Try and detect how the [product management] candidate feels about the target market and, most importantly, does the candidate respect and empathize with that target market? Or does he view his job as "enlightening" the target market?

…always hire people that you believe are smarter than yourself, and then do everything you can to help them succeed.

Make the designer a key part of your product team, and include her in your customer sessions, personas, product brainstorming, and in deciding your product strategy and roadmap.

…the main reason why I think most product managers are not focused [on strategy] is ego. They think that they are the ones that must always come up with the big ideas, and that if someone else did, what would their purpose be?

Most managers prefer to see your recommendations on how to solve problems you encounter rather than just a statement of the problem... this means an analysis of several alternatives along with your recommendations and rationale.

The purpose of a good product opportunity statement is to either prevent the company from wasting time… or focus the team and understand what will be required to succeed and how to define that success.

One useful technique I have found very useful is to always keep two versions of a product going in parallel. In other words, as soon as you start the engineering for release 1.0 and switch into execution mode for that project, then you start up the discovery for release 2.0 in parallel.

Product principles are not a list of features and, in fact, are not tied to any one product incarnation… A good sent of principles serves as the basis or foundation for inspiring product features.

If you find your product organization taking too long to make decisions, consider instituting a product council… [to make] the decision process informed, transparent, and timely. 

Make sure you release the software to [charter users] before the general release and make sure they are live and happy before the public release. When you launch, they'll be ready to stand up for you.

What technologies can I apply to solve this problem in a better way? What should the user experience be?

One of the most common mistake product teams make is confusing themselves with their customers.

… there's only one form of spec that can deliver [what's needed], and that is the high-fidelity prototype.

Once implementation begins, it becomes increasingly difficult to make the fundamental changes that will likely be necessary as you work through your experience design ideas.

…Come up with a high-fidelity prototype with the minimal functionality necessary to meet the business objectives, with a user experience that users can figure out how to use-and actually want to use.

…it is not enough to know that your product is feasible to build and will be usable. What really matters us whether or not your product is something users will find valuable.

You have a one-time-only opportunity what each user you test - the opportunity to learn how they think about this problem today, without your product. 

… don't fail into the trap of gathering subjective feedback, eliciting customer requirements and chasing features. Instead, focus on relentlessly pursing your metrics by studying live use and working the numbers in the right direction.

As a general rule, users don't like change… most people aren't excited about taking the time to learn a new way to do something they can already do.

The question is not whether there will be issues [after you release] but rather how quickly will you address them?

Using Agile is not an excuse for a lack of product planning.

…the waterfall method represents an idealistic but naive view of the software development process where people are able to anticipate the key issues and fully understand the requirements.

The idea is to create a high-fidelity prototype that mimics the eventual user experience. You need to validate this product design with real target users.

One of the easiest ways… to innovate is to just watch (and listen) as actual users attempt to use your current product or a competitor's product. 

Every organization is different. They key is to learn and accept how thing get done in your organization. Don't try to change the culture.

If Apple has a secret sauce as a technology company... it's this: They understand better than anyone else the role that emotion plays in getting consumers to crave, buy, and love a product.

…It is natural for any customer to want to describe their problem in terms of the solution they can envision rather than the underlying problem itself.

Great product leaders know that what is now possible is always changing. New technologies enable new solutions that may not have been possible of feasible until now.

If you apply [the] emotional lens, you can start to view things much more in line with how your users and customers view your service- and potential competitors.

…angry people dictate the future of technology.

…the disciples of interaction design and visual design are very different.

[Apply] 20% to scaling the product and infrastructure.

It's critical to design your product around the needs of your sales and distribution channel. Different channels require different capabilities. The key is to provide value all along the distribution chain.

One of the biggest mistakes platform product managers make is in the prioritization of the three constituencies… the end-user is often so far removed from the platform provider that they rarely interact directly.

Before you jump into the solution, [an opportunity assessment] makes sure you know what problem you're trying to solve, who you're trying to solve it for, and how you'll know if you are successful.
