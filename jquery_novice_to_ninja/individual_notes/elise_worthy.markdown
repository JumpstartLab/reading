## jQuery: Novice to Ninja

### 1. Subscription click-through path
https://github.com/eliseworthy/feed_engine/commit/81f00f3ec3a57dbde9dd0541f1864a147cfdf497

When a new user signs up, they're taken to a page where they can add new services (twitter, guthub, etc). I broke out the addition of services into divs that appear to be different pages, so the user can walk through the signup process easily.


### 2. Click-through button/steps
https://github.com/eliseworthy/feed_engine/commit/81f00f3ec3a57dbde9dd0541f1864a147cfdf497

To make this transition more robust, I added next step/previous step buttons and highlighting of the current step.
