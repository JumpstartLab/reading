# jQuery: Novice to Ninja
## Our site has infinite scrolling, so I added a floating mini-dashboard so that you can always have the pertinant information and links right there on the screen and don't have to go back to the top every time.  Had it working, then committed it and broke it, and here is the commit where I removed the unnecessary files that broke it:

## Also, because our site has infinite scrolling, I added a "back to top" button that shows up as you're scrolling and fades away when you stop.
