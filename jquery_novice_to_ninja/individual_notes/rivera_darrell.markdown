### Commit #1 - Dropdown menu

To make the headers cleaner, we put all actions for a user in a dropdown menu (see dashboard, posts, signout, etc)

### Commit #2 - Tooltip text on hover

On signup, users can link other accounts to their pointsfeed account by clicking on an icon.  To make it clearer, on hover, I added text that moves with the mouse that says you can add account to pointsfeed.
