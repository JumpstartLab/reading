# jQuery: Novice to Ninja
### 1. Infinite Scroll

In our project it got extremely annoying to constantly hit "next page". So I decided to use jQuery to implement an infinite scroll feature.

### 2. Meta data for links & images

In our project I wanted users to have more information about a link then simply "a link" so we decided to implement a jQuery function that takes the link inputted and renders out information about the link.
