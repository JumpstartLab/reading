## Discussion Notes

### Question 1

The concept of "The Lean Startup" is very pervasive in the development community right now.
What new insights or corrections to previous understandings did you develop in reading the text?
What elements get lost in the cocktail-conversation-level understanding of the book?

#### Notes

* Launch with something even if it's not perfect, just get it out there is a challenge for those of us with perfectionistic tendencies.
* A startup is a scientific process with testing hypotheses to see if they are right.
* Different types of pivoting and different types of growth.
* Very defined in most of the book, then left open ended to make work for individual companies.

### Question 2

The principles from "The Lean Startup" are easily applied to software.
But how would you use them to develop and launch a restaurant?

#### Notes

* It's applicable for music too - look at what lil wayne did, he put out a hundred types of videos on YouTube and whatever was popular he used.
* You could do a whole bunch of testing, and whatever is popular do.
* Pop up restaurants or food truck
* How does that work with branding? You'd have to brand the place, or have no brand at all.
* It'd be hard for people to peg what it is if you don't have some sort of image - but if you make the amorphousness of it part of the image, it works
* yOu probably wouldn't pay for a brick and mortar space, but maybe use delivery (or 918 F) and a vaporware video on kickstarter.
* Kickstarter is also a huge example of this - put out a minimum viable product and see if it has enough demand to make something happen.

### Question 3

How do the perscriptions of "The Lean Startup" match up with those from "Inspired"?
How do they conflict? How do you see LivingSocial practicing the ideas from "The Lean Startup"?

#### Notes

* Teams should be cross-functional.
* Customer knows what they want, vs you knowing what the customer wants.
* The principles in inspired are probably more applicable later on, whereas The Lean Startup is probably more usefull early on.
* LivingSocial can roll out a feature to a select group of users.

### Question 4

Is there something lost when "running lean"? Does it temper true innovation and creativity flourish?
Would the iPod exist?

#### Notes

* You might not get the wow launch. Certain aspects of creativity is lost because it's procedural.
* Yes if Steve Jobs wanted it so.

### Further Discussion

Imagine the internet gets unplugged and we need to find new careers. You've got $5K to start a lean business.
What would you pursue? What would be your value hypothesis? Growth hypothesis?

#### Notes

Value Hypothesis: People will pay for fast, reliable information after the "change". Test by having a manual process with a limited set of information in a small market. Some initial market ideas are related to food and survival.

Growth Hypothesis: Word of mouth will spread our business the best because people will be curious why the ones who use our service are surviving.
