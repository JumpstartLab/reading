## Discussion Notes

### Question 1

The concept of "The Lean Startup" is very pervasive in the development community right now. 
What new insights or corrections to previous understandings did you develop in reading the text? 
What elements get lost in the cocktail-conversation-level understanding of the book?

#### Notes

The Lean Startup is not a prescribed set of tactics.  Iteration & differing approaches are major themes.  "Just do it" vs. Lean Startup method seem to be equal at the cocktail-conversation-level understanding.  Concept of "intrapreneur" got lots of attention.  Elements of defining MVPs were more in-depth & supported with case studies (e.g., IMVU).

### Question 2

The principles from "The Lean Startup" are easily applied to software. 
But how would you use them to develop and launch a restaurant?

#### Notes

For refining your menu, you could pretty easily apply the lean startup tactics to that. The physical location of your restaurant is semi-constraining but is not impossible to overcome. You could start with a pop-up location, then move to a food truck, and then go into a real B&M shop. There's also a lot of room for experimentation with small batch sizes (different serving sizes).

### Question 3

How do the perscriptions of "The Lean Startup" match up with those from "Inspired"? 
How do they conflict? How do you see LivingSocial practicing the ideas from "The Lean Startup"?

Inspired and Lean Startup had a lot of similar content but inspired was written for product managers. Lean
startup suggests not building anything to try out the product - just build a splash page. Living social does a lot of a/b testing, constant iteration, and continuous deployment. Also, we have had lots of different pivots (pick 5, visual bookshelf, buy your friend a drink, deals).

#### Notes

### Question 4

Is there something lost when "running lean"? Does it tempter true innovation and creativity flourish?
Would the iPod exist?

#### Notes

Not universally applicable, many ways to skin a cat
Some areas this cannot be applied like academic/scientific research (Nasa space launch)
No, the ipod would not exist

### Further Discussion

Imagine the internet gets unplugged and we need to find new careers. You've got $5K to start a lean business.
What would you pursue? What would be your value hypothesis? Growth hypothesis? 

#### Notes

Restaurants.
