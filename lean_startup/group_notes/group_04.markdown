## Discussion Notes

### Question 1

The concept of "The Lean Startup" is very pervasive in the development community right now. 
What new insights or corrections to previous understandings did you develop in reading the text? 
What elements get lost in the cocktail-conversation-level understanding of the book?

#### Notes

* The analytics piece was lost on us prior to reading the book.
* The pivot concept was interesting. There might be two types of opportunities when to pivot: when you're obviously failing, and when you're not doing as well as you'd hope you'd do.
* The MVP for Concierge was interesting. Shouldn't an MVP be an actual product?

### Question 2

The principles from "The Lean Startup" are easily applied to software. 
But how would you use them to develop and launch a restaurant?

#### Notes

* Food Truck
* 918F pop-up
* Farmer's market samples
* Have customers vote favorite and least favorite items / propose menu changes
* A/B test menus

### Question 3

How do the prescriptions of "The Lean Startup" match up with those from "Inspired"? 
How do they conflict? How do you see LivingSocial practicing the ideas from "The Lean Startup"?

#### Notes

* Lean Startup advocates going through the whole product cycle quickly with even weight. Inspired seems to advocate more precise product planning before any execution begins. 
- Inspired seems to imply that mistakes can be avoided with enough planning - Lean Startup advocates lots of experiments.
* LivingSocial doesn't seem to do too much market research (at least that we've seen). LS fails fast.

### Question 4

Is there something lost when "running lean"? Does it temper true innovation or help creativity flourish?
Would the iPod exist?

#### Notes

* Bureaucracy is lost!
* Management will have a harder time getting on board with lean.
* Generally, in bigger organizations, you lose the traditions that made your company successful. Change is hard, and it's unlikely that everyone will get on board.
* Yes the iPod would exist. It may have been of a different form and a different rollout...but Apple doesn't do it that way. 

### Further Discussion

Imagine the internet gets unplugged and we need to find new careers. You've got $5K to start a lean business.
What would you pursue? What would be your value hypothesis? Growth hypothesis? 

#### Notes

* Dan: test prep. MCAT tutoring.
* Andy: sell food. He would be interested in packaging and distributing food. He makes really good cheesecake bars. He's going to make us all of these bars. Anyways, it's a lot of cheescake, nutella, cookies, and coronary failure.
* Jonan: invest in carrier pigeons. Actually he would try to help people start businesses.
* Mike: social media blog for cats.
