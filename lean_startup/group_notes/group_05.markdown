## Discussion Notes

### Question 1

The concept of "The Lean Startup" is very pervasive in the development community right now. 
What new insights or corrections to previous understandings did you develop in reading the text? 
What elements get lost in the cocktail-conversation-level understanding of the book?

#### Notes

* A lot of individuals just eat up the buzzwords without any substance behind them. The hypothesis element gets lost in cocktail conversations - you should know ahead of time what success looks like. A scientific experiment is no good without a hypothesis - you won't know what to measure, you won't know what to fix. If things go unexpectedly well, you should be able to quickly pivot. 

### Question 2

The principles from "The Lean Startup" are easily applied to software. 
But how would you use them to develop and launch a restaurant?

#### Notes

* Start by being very careful about what you're measuring; repeat business is probably an important indicator. The restaurant concept itself should probably be a little risky (or disruptive). Small batches. Pick one thing and do it really well (Five Guys) and/or be ready to pivot quickly (food truck style). Food trucks are probably the best example of lean startup principles in a restaurant setting.

### Question 3

How do the prescriptions of "The Lean Startup" match up with those from "Inspired"? 
How do they conflict? How do you see LivingSocial practicing the ideas from "The Lean Startup"?

#### Notes

* LivingSocial likes to talk about its pivots at every opportunity. What those are and when they happen are harder to pin down, but we talk about them a lot. If you have a product that takes off, great, but if it fails then you need to pivot those people. That's doable. Pivoting 5000 people would be impossible.

### Question 4

Is there something lost when "running lean"? Does it tempter true innovation and creativity flourish?
Would the iPod exist?

#### Notes

* I don't feel that the iPod would exist. Products at Apple are released before their time and slowly gain traction. However, there is an advantage to having the "pockets" of Apple. The iPod was never viewed as NOT successful. Focus on one product and do it well. Need to be good at saying "no" and apologizing for nothing. 

### Further Discussion

Imagine the internet gets unplugged and we need to find new careers. You've got $5K to start a lean business.
What would you pursue? What would be your value hypothesis? Growth hypothesis? 

#### Notes

* Mark & Chris: I would start the bar truck. A food truck that is a bar. 
* Elise: International Tourism. As tourism increases in smaller countries, make tourists feel comfortable in supporting local goods by bridging the gap.
* Mary: Art dealership.
