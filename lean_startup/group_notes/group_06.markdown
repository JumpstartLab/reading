## Discussion Notes

### Question 1

The concept of "The Lean Startup" is very pervasive in the development community right now.
What new insights or corrections to previous understandings did you develop in reading the text?
What elements get lost in the cocktail-conversation-level understanding of the book?

#### Notes

#### New Insights
* Have clear metrics defined in which you define success. It is crucial that just because you are "gaining" customers, or increasing payments that doesn't mean your business is increasing.
#### Lost in cocktail
* It didn't give exact examples of what metrics are crucial
** However we have come to the conclusion that this is because you can't use his exact metrics for your business
#### General Notes
* How do you actually iterate over your product. People say "iterate, iterate, iterate" but when do you take a step back and actually look at what you are building. -- The actual point of the book is that you should iterate methodically and evaluate yourself, but a lot people simply stop at the "iterate" part.
* Question: Some of his examples of people starting out in very non-technical ways (e.g. Groupon or Food on the Table service) seem a little ridiculous -- do we really have to do this.

### Question 2

The principles from "The Lean Startup" are easily applied to software.
But how would you use them to develop and launch a restaurant?

#### Notes

* 1 - try starting it out of your house/an available kitchen before making huge investments in industrial cooking facility
* 2 - Be adaptive with your concept/menu/ambience - most restuarants try to roll out with a thoroughly developed concept, but what would it look like if you developed the concept gradually as you gained customers.
* 3 - Use friends/family as test-customers -- or better yet find actual strangers -- to validate demand and make sure your stuff is good.
* 4 - Keep an eye on profit margins etc.
* 5 - Keep the mindset of iterating and being open to new opportunities. Many small businesses fail because they have only one idea, and if it doesn't pan out they aren't prepared to iterate and develop new ones.

### Question 3

How do the perscriptions of "The Lean Startup" match up with those from "Inspired"?
How do they conflict? How do you see LivingSocial practicing the ideas from "The Lean Startup"?

#### Notes

* 1 - cross-functional teams to get feedback loop smaller again
* 2 - results only work environment
* 3 - LivingSocial working with KPIs that measure each product according to what it should be measured by.  That allows iteration based on the proper metrics.
* 4 - Conflict with fast moving, tightly controlled, measured, iterate.  Different from ROWE which could set people free to figure it out and not necessarily encourage as much structure.
* 5 - Lean Startup is more for management, Inspired is more anti-management.

### Question 4

Is there something lost when "running lean"? Does it tempter true innovation and creativity flourish?
Would the iPod exist?

#### Notes

* 1 - Competition from someone who has more money could release something with more features
* 2 - Easier to get off the ground by going lean
* 3 - Encourages businesses to settle on what works first versus keeping something that may be creative but hard to get off the ground

### Further Discussion

Imagine the internet gets unplugged and we need to find new careers. You've got $5K to start a lean business.
What would you pursue? What would be your value hypothesis? Growth hypothesis?

#### Notes

* 1 - Food truck with four mini food items and test them around in different areas and see what sells best where
* 2 - Value hypothesis: do people find value in food?  yes
* 3 - Growth hypothesis: flashy truck, sirens blaring, word of mouth
