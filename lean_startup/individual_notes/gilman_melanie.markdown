### Chapter 1

The Lean Startup emphasizes a new way of measuring progress & productivity, fast iteration, customer insight, & adjustments based on results.


### Chapter 2

A startup is where a new product is designed under conditions of extreme uncertainty. The company can be of any age, size, or industry.


### Chapter 3

Validated learning is acquiring empirical knowledge about a startup and its prospects. Figure out what is value-creating and what is waste.


### Chapter 4

A lean startup applies the scientific method. Come up with a hypothesis and test it on actual customers as early as possible.


### Chapter 5

Metrics are people too. On the other side of the numbers are individuals. You must see a probelm for yourself before you can solve it.


### Chapter 6

Minimum viable product is built to test a business hypothesis and start learning without waste. Don't overbuild and overpromise.


### Chapter 7

Metrics should be actionable: clear cause and effect; accessible: easy for everyone to understand; auditable: credible to employees.


### Chapter 8

Deciding whether to pivot (new hypothesis) or persevere is difficult. Validated learning gives you the data you need to make that decision.


### Chapter 9

Small batches are counterintuitive but superior. Allows greater flexibility, minimizes expenditures, and problems can be identified sooner.


### Chapter 10

There are three engines of growth -- sticky, viral, and paid -- and each has a different set of metrics to learn from in order to succeed.


### Chapter 11

A startup needs to adapt as it grows. One way to evolve gradually is the Five Whys: when something goes wrong, ask why 5x to trace its origin.


### Chapter 12

An innovation sandbox can exist within a larger company. It is a small team that operates like a startup, and if successful is reintegrated.
