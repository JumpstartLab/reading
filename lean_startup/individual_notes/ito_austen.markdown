# Chapter 1

"Learning, by contrast, is frustrating intagible".


# Chapter 2

Startups can exist everywhere from 2 people in a garage to large enterprises.
As long as they meet the criteria of building something new and they are under
extreme uncertaintity.

# Chapter 3

"See, we thought we should get a gold start just for listening to our
customers. Except our customers still didn't like the product."

# Chapter 4

"Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the
customer's problem."

# Chapter 5 

"The goal of such early contact with customers is not to gain definitive
answers. Instead, it is to clarify at a basic coarse level that we understand
our potential customer and what problems they have."

# Chapter 6

The MVP doesn't need to be built. It can be anything that will allow you to
learn about who your customers are and what they want.

# Chapter 7 

"We need the courage to put aside our beliefs of what quality is."

# Chapter 8

Pivoting is making a change based on what you have learned. If you are learning
the right things from the actionable metrics, you can change and continue
iterating toward growth.

# Chapter 9

Continuous deployment is not only limited to software. Hardware manufacturers
can use 3D printing to achieve the same effect as software continuous
deployment.

# Chapter 10

The assumption that our product has achieved product/market fit, we won't have
to pivot is wrong. I didn't know that you need to continue to pivot even after
your business is "successful". If you aren't innovating you're dying.

# Chapter 11

On the first day of work, developers can and should push their changes to a
production environment. While scary, I feel like it builds culture,
accountability, trust, and empowerment.

# Chapter 12

I feel like one of the goals of Hungry Academy is to create a startup-like
culture. Jeff and Matt want to empower us to experiment and figure out what
works and what doesn't. They are teaching us to be agile because when we finish
we are going to own whatever we create.
