Chapter 1
  Entepreneurs need to rethink the manaagement of startups in order to raise their success rate. Bureaucracy is bad, but chaos isn't better

Chapter 3
  Audacity of zero: "Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize"

Chapter 4

Chapter 5
  Success theatre: 'using the appearance of growth to make it seem that they are successful', 'growth through continuous fundraising from investors and lots of paid advertising.' - Facebook anyone?

Chapter 6
  Minimum viable product is the fastest way to get through Build-Measure-Learn with the minimum amount of effort. Test fundamental business hypothesis
