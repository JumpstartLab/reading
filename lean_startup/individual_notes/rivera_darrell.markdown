###Chapter 1
"The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the things customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible."

###Chapter 2
"A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty"

###Chapter 3
"Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste"

###Chapter 4
"The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopterS: the customers who eel the need for the product most acutely.  Those customers tend to be mroe forgiving of mistakes and are especailly eager to give feedback."

###Chapter 5
"...two leaps of faith stand above all others: the value creation hypothesis and the growth hypothesis."

###Chapter 6
"A minimum viable product(MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.  It is not necessarily the smallest product imagineable, though: it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort."

###Chapter 7
"A startup's job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2_ devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan"

###Chapter 8
"Companies that cannot bring themselves to pivot to a new direction on the basis of fedback from the marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from employees and other stakeholders but not moving ahead"

###Chapter 9
"Working in small batches ensures that a startup can minimize the expenditure of time, money, and effort that ultimately turns out to have been wasted"

###Chapter 10
"Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers."

###Chapter 11
"I ask teams to adopt these simple rules: (1) Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time. (2) Never allow the same mistake to be made twice."

###Chapter 12
"I strongly recommend that startup teams be completely cross-functional, that is, have full-time representation from every funcitonal department in the company that will be involved in the creation or launch of their early products."
