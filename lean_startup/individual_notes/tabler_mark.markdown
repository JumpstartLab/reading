1.  Because you can't forecast your path with complete accuracy, you must maintain enough agility to adjust your course on the way.

2.  You don't have to back your initiatives sight-unseen; better to launch five products and decide which one(s) deserve more investment and which get dropped.

3.  It's amazing how an "obviously correct" assumption can be proven so dramatically false.  "It's not the things you don't know; it's the false things you're sure about that get you in trouble." 

4.  The trick these days isn't coming up with a billion-dollar idea overnight; the trick is to be willing to experiment with, and throw out or refine, nineteen mediocre ideas so that you can cash in on the 20th run.

5.  Everything is its own situation.  You can learn from previous examples, but remember they are neither perfectly similar nor perfectly different from your own case.

6.  I'm put off by the assumption that MVP means buggy.  You can launch a polished, stable, minimum product without sacrificing quality; glitches and hiccups are alright but system-crashing issues are not.

7.  It's exactly like the scientific method: you must be willing to let go of your hypothesis if disproven.  Confirmation bias can undermine all your efforts.

8.  If you don't know where you're going, you don't know when you're lost.  If you're worried about running out of gas, you can't be afraid of u-turns; sometimes there is no way forward.


9.  Producing too much of anything at a time is non-agile; better to get the process of making small batches down to a very quick science and respond to market demand.

10.  Measuring the growth of your startup in the wrong way is as nonsensical as measuring your car's mileage in terms of lakes passed per restaurant visit.

11.   Be ready to change at the shallowest and the deepest levels of your structure or organization as soon as you see evidence that you need to - and hunt for that evidence relentlessly.

12.  Once you've got something great, there is no reason to stop there.  There is no product so timeless that it can't get better under your guidance.
