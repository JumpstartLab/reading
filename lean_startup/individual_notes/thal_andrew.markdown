# Lean Startup
## Ch 1
* Don't overplan in a startup. Get something out the door and test with users, then iterate. It's more like driving than programming a rocket ship.
## Ch 2
* Entrepreneurs and startups are not just in small companies. The lean startup philosophy succeeds in large companies too.
## Ch 3
* How do you hide data from potential investors while using it to help iterate? Interesting how a product's features can fit a different purpose than intended.
## Ch 4
* Concierge mvp is an interesting twist. It's also amazing to me how people will repsonse to broken products and show you what you need to do next.
## Ch 5
* Value hypothesis and Growth hypothesis. There are many successes and failures at the right place/time. Those who learn what is desired and iterate win.
## Ch 6
* It is incredible how a crappy MVP can be more desirable and can shift the direction of a product, or make vcs more interested in a company.
## Ch 7
* Measure results, know what to measure, know what you are measuring, and always test small changes to the current version.
## Ch 8
* I like the idea of a frequent pivot or persevere meeting. Then you keep open communication and can constantly evaluate the decisions of the business rather than having a freak out all at once.
## Ch 9
* Efficient process is important for growth. Only make what you need and when you need it. Small batches allow for constant tweaks.
## Ch 10
* One of the leap of faith assumptions can be about how the product will grow. Sometimes the pivot is just the method in which the product is expected to grow.
## Ch 11
* Be tolerant of mistakes the first time. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.
## Ch 12
* Bad data is just as bad as no data. Learn how to test properly and how to make decisions off of data that matters. Set forth the metrics for all tests ahead of time.
## Ch 13
* Big companies should employ the Lean Startup philosophy if they want to be more efficient and see more success.
