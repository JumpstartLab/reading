# Lean Startup Notes - Travis Valentine

#### Chapter 1 - Start

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Startups also have a true north, a destination in mind: creating a thriving and world-changing business. I call that a startup’s vision. To achieve that vision, startups employ a strategy, which includes a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The product is the end result of this strategy (see the chart on this page).

* _The Central Premise_

  The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible. In other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.

  Entrepreneurship is management.


#### Chapter 2 - Define

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Most tools from general management are not designed to flourish in the harsh soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups thrive. The future is unpredictable, customers face a growing array of alternatives, and the pace of change is ever increasing. Yet most startups—in garages and enterprises alike—still are managed by using standard forecasts, product milestones, and detailed business plans.

* _The Central Premise_

  Innovation is a bottoms-up, decentralized, and unpredictable thing, but that doesn’t mean it cannot be managed.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  The entrepreneurial prerequisites are: proper team structure, good personnel, a strong vision for the future, and an appetite for risk taking.


#### Chapter 3 - Learn

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Metcalfe’s law: the value of a network as a whole is proportional to the square of the number of participants. It is also the right way to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much stuff we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re getting for our efforts.

* _The Central Premise_

  Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It is a rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste.


#### Chapter 4 - Experiment

* _A Memorable Quote_

  The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.

* _The Central Premise_

  Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens—but won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  In the Lean Startup model, an experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry; it is also a first product.


#### Chapter 5 - Leap

* _A Memorable Quote_

  The problem with most entrepreneurs’ plans is generally not that they don’t follow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon which they are based are wrong.

* _The Central Premise_

  What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  Innovation accounting, a quantitative approach that allows us to see whether our engine-tuning efforts are bearing fruit. It also allows us to create learning milestones, which are an alternative to traditional business and product milestones. Learning milestones are useful for entrepreneurs as a way of assessing their progress accurately and objectively; they are also invaluable to managers and investors who must hold entrepreneurs accountable.


#### Chapter 6 - Test

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Contrary to traditional product development, which usually involves a long, thoughtful incubation period and strives for product perfection, the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.

* _The Central Premise_

  Lean Startup method is not opposed to building high-quality products, but only in service of the goal of winning over customers. We must be willing to set aside our traditional professional standards to start the process of validated learning as soon as possible.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.


#### Chapter 7 - Measure

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Innovation accounting works in three steps: first, use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now. startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. That is the third step: pivot or persevere.

* _The Central Premise_

  Standard accounting is not helpful in evaluating entrepreneurs. The three A's of metrics: auditable, accessible, and actionable.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  The idea of cohort analysis.


#### Chapter 8 - Pivot (or Persevere)

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Startup productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It is about aligning our efforts with a business and product that are working to create value and drive growth. In other words, successful pivots put us on a path toward growing a sustainable business.

* _The Central Premise_

  Pivots are tough to do and can be done in different ways, some changing the core concept more dramatically than others (see page 172).

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  Seasoned entrepreneurs often speak of the runway that their startup has left: the amount of time remaining in which a startup must either achieve lift-off or fail. This usually is defined as the remaining cash in the bank divided by the monthly burn rate, or net drain on that account balance.


#### Chapter 9 - Batch

* _A Memorable Quote_

  The goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently. It is to—as quickly as possible—learn how to build a sustainable business.

* _A Question Yet Unanswered_

  Batches seem tied to hardware, but if viewed in terms of software, aren't most startups producing in batches? Is continuous deployment really still controversial and why?

* _The Central Premise_

  Startups practice just-in-time scalability, conducting product experiments without making massive up-front investments in planning and design.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  It is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste.


#### Chapter 10 - Grow

* _A Memorable Quote_

  The way to find growth is to focus on existing customers for the product even more engaging to them. Growth happens automatically as a side effect of customers using the product.

* _The Central Premise_

  The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth. Sustainable growth follows one of three engines of growth: paid, viral, or sticky. Coupled with innovation accounting, this allows startups to figure out when their growth is at risk of running out and pivot accordingly.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth: Word of mouth, as a side effect of product usage, through funded advertising, and through repeat purchase or use.


#### Chapter 11 - Adapt

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Having a low-quality product can inhibit learning when the defects prevent customers from experiencing (and giving feedback on) the product’s benefits.

* _The Central Premise_

  Build an adaptive organization by investing in the right amount of process to keep teams nimble as they grow.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  The Five Whys, the core idea of which is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms.


#### Chapter 12 - Innovate

* _A Memorable Quote_

  Sabotage is a rational response from managers whose territory is threatened.

* _The Central Premise_

  Maintaining a startup culture in an established organization is difficult, but by doing multiple kinds of work in parralel it is possible.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  The author's suggested solution to build innovation within existing companies: to create a sandbox for innovation that will contain the impact of the new innovation but not constrain the methods of the startup team.


#### Chapter 13 - Epilogue: Waste Not

* _A Memorable Quote_

  If we stopped wasting people’s time, what would they do with it?

* _The Central Premise_

  Takes a more historical look at the methodologies put forth in the book. As a movement, the Lean Startup must avoid doctrines and rigid ideology. We must avoid the caricature that science means formula or a lack of humanity in work. In fact, science is one of humanity’s most creative pursuits. I believe that applying it to entrepreneurship will unlock a vast storehouse of human potential.

* _A new idea or connection it triggered for me_

  Our productive capacity greatly exceeds our ability to know what to build.


#### Chapter 14 - Join the Movement

* _The Central Premise_
