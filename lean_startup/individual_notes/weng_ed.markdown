Chapter 1
Launching a startup is more like driving a car than launching a rocket ship. You don't need to plan out every single detail in order to be successful.

Chapter 2
"A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty." This definition says nothing about size, industry, or sector.

"Innovation is a bottoms-up, decentralized, and unpredictable thing, but that doesn't mean it cannot be managed. It can, but to do so requires a new man agement discipline, one that needs to be mastered not just by practicing entrepreneurs seeking to build the next big thing but also by the people who support them, nurture them, and hold them accountable. In other words, cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management."

Chapter 3 - Learn
Metcalfe's law: the value of a network as a whole is pro portional to the square of the number of participants... Facebook's value must be huge.

"Which of our efforts are value-creating and which are wasteful? This question is at the heart of the lean manufacturing revolution."

Chapter 4 - Experiment
Build a simple product to truly learn about your market. Don't rely on surveys or existing market research.

Steer
Chapter 5 - Leap
Leaps of faith are assumptions on which a startup's success hinges. If they are true, tremendous opportunity awaits.

Chapter 6 - Test
MVP is the fatest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypothesis, not just to answer product design or technical questions.

Chapter 7 - Measure
Innovation accounting has three steps:
1. Use a MVP to establish real data on where the company is right now.
2. Tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal.
3. Pivot or persevere.

Chapter 8 - Pivot (or Persevere)
The true measure of runway is how many pivots a startup has left. Therefore, extending the runway can include getting to each pivot faster.

Chapter 9 - Batch
The process used to design a product is sometimes stuck in the era of mass production. In the case of the iPhone, all 1,500 changes were released to customers in one giant batch.

IMVU used small batches released to small numbers of people that were then A/B tested vs. other batches.

Chapter 10 - Grow
There are four ways past customers drive sustainable growth:
1. Word of mouth.
2. As a side effect of product usage.
3. Through funded advertising.
4. Through repeat purchase or use.

Chapter 11 - Adapt
Consider using a training program to bring new engineers up to speed. It might cost you in the short term, but the increased effectiviness will pay off in the long run.

Chapter 12 - Innovate
Too much budget is as harmful as too little—as countless dot-com failures can attest—and startups are extremely sensitive to midcourse budgetary changes.

Chapter 13 - Epilogue: Waste Not

A Long-Term Stock Exchange could be designed to sustain long-term thinking. We could tie compensation to long term revenue and trade on innovation accounting.
