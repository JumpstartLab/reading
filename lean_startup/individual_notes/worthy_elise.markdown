#Introduction  
Don't always do what your customers ask. Run experiments on them, don't cater to their whims. 

#Chapter 1  

"Startups are designed to confront situations of extreme uncertainty."

#Chapter 2  

If you don't have anything, you lose very little. Conduct experiments by offering customers the chance to try something and then measure their behavior. 

#Chapter 3 

"Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future business prospects."

#Chapter 4  

If you are doing something totally new, you can't rely on market research to validate your ideas. Test your assumptions empirically at the start of your process.

#Chapter 5  

"The problem with most entrepreneurs' plans is generally not that they don't follow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon which they are base are wrong."

#Chapter 6  

You have to sell your product to early adopters first. They actually don't want the full product - they want to be the one to influence features and spread the knowledge of something new. Don't make things too polished at first.

#Chapter 7  

You must have quantitative results that allow you to declare failure and allow you to move on. When the metrics are poor, it's an opportunity to pivot.

#Chapter 8 

"The more money, time, and creative energy that has been sunk into an idea, the harder it is to pivot."

#Chapter 9 

Practice just-in-time scalability to ensure you don't make unneeded upfront investments in ideas that won't pan out.

#Chapter 10

"Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers."

#Chapter 11

Whenever there is an issue, get to the root cause, not just what is superficially linked. Do this by asking yourself five whys: each one about the cause of the next.

#Chapter 12

Startups in larger organizations must have autonomy to make decisions and execute. They will be stifled if their are too many layers in the approval process.
