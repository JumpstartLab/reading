## Assignment

For Reading Group 4/30 purchase and read the first four chapters of "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt, http://amzn.com/020161622X

Create a markdown text file and, after each chapter of reading, record:

1. Summarize the chapter in a tweet - 140 characters

#### Small Group

Fork the `reading` repository and collate your group's notes into the appropriate file in https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/pragmatic_programmer/composite_notes

Each member of the group is responsible for one discussion question and recording notes on the group's responses. It should **NOT** be one person taking notes the entire time. The person who poses the question takes the notes. When you're not taking notes, close your laptop.

Consider using an 8-minute timer for each question's discussion.

Submit 1 pull request for your group when you finish the notes. It should not contain changes to any files or folders other than your group's markdown file.

Be back in the main room, pull request submitted, and seated with your group at 2:15.
