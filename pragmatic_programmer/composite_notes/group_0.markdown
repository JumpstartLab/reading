* Outdated: Specific ips for staying current.

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself.
* Yes yes. Also talked about how to write good code so you don't make mistakes later.

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?
* Become a master in one thing. Got excited to learn command line.

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly?
* When you document, document well and update your documentation. Prepare for change.
