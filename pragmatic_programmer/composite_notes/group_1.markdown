# Small Group Discussion of "The Pragmatic Programmer - Part 1"

### Group 1

Group members: Austen Ito, Jan Koszewski, Edward Weng, Horace Williams

### Discussion Summary

#### A: Pragmatic Philosophy -- This section was trying to lay the groundwork. Were there any ideas from which particularly stood out? Any seem outdated?

  Invest in your knowledge porfolio because things in the tech space change all the time. Have pride in your work and keep technical debt at a reasonable levels.

  The only thing that really seems outdated are Dave Thomas's suggestions to go to the library. The good practices will be good for long periods of time.

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself. 

  We are reminded that in our systems there are subsystems and in order to preserve cleanliness, we should be isolating each subsystem (single responsibility principle).

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?

  We're definitely encouraged to start doing more in the shell. The vim army is growing larger, one zealot at a time.

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly? 

  Your responsibility as a programmer is to create easy-to-understand and easy-to-maintain code bases. This could be through documentation, testing, or many other ways, but it's important for yourself and future programmers.
