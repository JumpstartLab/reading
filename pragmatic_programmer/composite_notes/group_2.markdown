### Discussion Summary

#### A: Pragmatic Philosophy -- This section was trying to lay the groundwork. Were there any ideas from which particularly stood out? Any seem outdated?

* MT: It was a solid foundation to start with.
* JS: I'm a fan of this guy and his philosophy.
* MT: If one particular thing stood out it would be "the cat ate my source code". Something just resonated about you're being hired or contracted to deliver code, not explanations for why there is no code.
* JS: Right, you're being hired to deliver code
* MT: It's like artists - you're not being paid to be a butt in a seat.
* CS: I liked the broken windows metaphor. If I see a bunch of crap and it's abandoned and it's left there forever - how does that make sense? It is like what I see. I can't help patchworking stuff on top of other stuff. No one intends to get the snowball of "this is yuck, let's just tack stuff onto it", but it does happen and it continues.

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself.

* MT: Why did DRY become the most popular concept?
* JS: I think programmers thrive on productivity. We feel like we have to move past the problem and not rehash old work.
* MT: I think that's probably why it got picked up, the productivity feeling - but I think that it was expressed in the book as a code-maintenance concern.
* JQ: Right, it's something to keep your code working.
* JS: I had to reafactor a lot of my roles model for SOSE because it was strewn all over the app.

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?

* JQ: I'm certainly tempted by VIM. I have other things I need to learn first.
* MT: I am not sure I agree with that - that there are other things to learn first.
* JS: It makes me want to re-read my UNIX administrator's handbook...
* CS: I was thinking of taking a look at that...
* MT: It made me realize I am not using all of my tools as well as I could.
* JS: Absolutely. It made me want to be more efficient in my use of VIM... there are lots of features that I'm not using.
* CS: There are two plugins for find that I know about... for Ctrl+P. It was hard not to be graphical and traverse down trees - a lot of people use nerdtree - but now I just use Cmd + P...

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly? 

* JQ: Name things well.
* CS: You consolidate your domain knowledge into one area. Know when to abstract something out of a module, weigh the cost-benefit analysis.
* JQ: I think it's just something you learn over time.
* CS: More intuition than science? It's about what makes sense to the people working on it.
* JS: The purpose of code in general is to be read by human beings. The hundred people who come after you have to make sense of it to.
* CS: I think you have to take into account what you're doing - a framework is going to be harder to read than a web app.
* MT: The skill of the reader comes into play - it's like writing at the third or the twelvth grade level; the words are more challenging but the importance of grammar doesn't change.
