### Discussion Summary

#### A: Pragmatic Philosophy -- This section was trying to lay the groundwork. Were there any ideas from which particularly stood out? Any seem outdated?

Broken windows: if there's a crummy part of your code, others will treat you code poorly and it will just get worse. Care about your code. 

This chapter is high-level, so not much can be outdated. All seem like current ideas still.

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself. 

Andy is opposed?
Clean code is good code.
Take time to make rational decisions, judgements, and estimations. This takes discipline, but saves pain later.
Prototype to learn, tracer bullets.

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?

Andy: It made me really want to get good at one. Learn to use the command-line script. 
Elise: it is okay to be good at one editor before transitioning to something in the command-line.
Andy: Also, fuck vim, can you write that in there? (general agreement) More puns.

The tools are the most important part of a craftsman's environment, so mastering them is critical for success.

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly? 

Defensive programming is important - you're never going to inheirit perfect code and you're never going to write perfect code. 

Finish what you start - literatlly - so others only have to deal with completed ideas.

Design by contract -> we now do this with testing (for the pre and post conditions)
