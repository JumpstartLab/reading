# Small Group Discussion of "The Pragmatic Programmer - Part 1"

### Group

Group members: Nisarg Shah & Conan Rimmer & Michael Verdi

### Discussion Summary

#### A: Pragmatic Philosophy -- This section was trying to lay the groundwork. Were there any ideas from which particularly stood out? Any seem outdated?

Stand-outs -
* Good-enough software
* "Fires are bad for trees" | Broken window theory
* Your Knowledge Portfolio

Outdated -
* Communicate! - "E-Mail Communication" section
* Your Knowledge Portfolio - "Care and Cultivation of Gurus" section

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself. 

Chapter delves into 4 methods of duplication & offers suggestions to avoid them.  Most seemed still relevant and useful.  Highlights were "Orthogonality" (independent modules), "green" code (re-use & reduced duplication), & "reversibility" (module layering).

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?

Increased CLI & VIM (due to "Shell Game" & "Power Editing"); plus increased use of custom & system key bindings.

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly?

Explicit naming & well-doc'ed APIs for modules works well.
