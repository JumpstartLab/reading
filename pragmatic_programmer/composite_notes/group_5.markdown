# Small Group Discussion of "The Pragmatic Programmer - Part 1"

### Group 5

Group members: Mike Silvis, Mary Cutrali, Darrell Rivera, Travis Valentine

### Discussion Summary

#### A: Pragmatic Philosophy -- This section was trying to lay the groundwork. Were there any ideas from which particularly stood out? Any seem outdated?

* MC: I wouldn't say outdated, they were more so just tips to be a good employee.
* MS: I agree, it was more about how to conduct yourself within a team and be productive.
* DR: It was interesting because there are so many tips about how to be as a person. It sort of admits that some in the community could stand to remind themselves to stay humble, etc.
* TV: I thought it was neat how the emphasis on learning is so pervasive. It seems like this field values constant learning more than any other.

#### B: Pragmatic Approach -- This section outlines the most popular concept from the book, Don't Repeat Yourself. 

* MS: I like the concept of writing the documentation before you write your code. That way your scope is well-defined as you go through implementation.
* MC: Working on this project shows the importance of writing code that allows for reuse.
* DR: Especially when things change so much. It's important that you don't have redundancy when you change.
* TV: In that vein, it's important that it doesn't repeat itself so you can pinpoint issues easier. If something blows up you have a better idea of where to fix it if that code only appears once.

#### C: The Basic Tools -- Programmers love their tools. Did this section convince you to try out new things? Bash scripts? Vim? Emacs?

* MC: I'm not convinced to try new things, just maybe experiment with them. That way if I'm on another person's computer I'm not lost if they use different tools.
* MS: I think it's more about where you are most productive. You should stick to the tools that help you the most.
* DR: I get the value of understanding new tools, but to me the theme of the chapter was that the solution is what's most important. And that this field respects and requires learning more than others.
* TV: I think it's an interesting suggestion, but I feel like I'm not well-versed enough in Sublime to say I need vim.
* MS: Yeah, I haven't hit the ceiling of what Sublime can do so I don't feel pulled to vim or anything like that.

#### D: Pragmatic Paranoia -- These ideas really revolve around the responsibility of code. Techniques like modularization can have a high benefit but also a high cost in complexity. How do you write code responsibly? 

* MS: I came away with the understanding that I should never write in C or Java.
* MC: Ensure that the code you write does not do more or less than promised.
* DR: The Design with Contracts idea - After dealing with contracts on a daily basis with the production team, following what is in writing prevents hassle on both ends of the group.
* MS: The concept of agile development seems to contradict that a bit though.
* MC: It's also important that a process should be responsible for deallocating the resources it allocates.
* TV: And documenting that is important too. So whatever your code is supposed to do should be checked.
