Favorite Tips

To code orthogonal means to eliminate unnecessary effects between items

You will likely need to reverse an old decision. Code with this in mind. Code to reverse

Noone writes perfect software. Get ready to interface with other peoples imperfect code. Make yours easy to interface with

Some things are better done than described. Specifications should reduce requirements to a place where a programmers skill can take over

Pragmatic projects need ruthless testing, smart teaming, useful automation and through documentation

Tips

Be a tenacious tester!  State coverage, not code coverage counts. Write deep tests. Test your tests #testsontestsontests
