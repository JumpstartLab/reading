Be really smart. That's pretty important.

Take the time to make rational decisions, judgements, and estimations. This take discipline, but saves pain later.

tips:
Don't Repeat Yourself
There are no final decisions

Clean code is good code, but you can always make edits later.

Tweet Summary:
Keep your toolset sharp and ready to use; add to it regularly. Plain text is powerful.

tips:
Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
Always use source code control

Source code control helps you track issues! Don't be an idiot - track your stuff!

Tweet Summary:
No software is perfect. Design by contract. Raise exceptions. Finish what you start.

tips:
You can't write perfect software.
Crash early - "Java raise a runtime exception"

Watch for issues in code, but accept them as a fact of life. Release, or else you may never.

Tweet Summary:
Metadata is your friend; decouple modules; build services that can live autonomously.

Tips:
- Minimize coupling between modules: again, extensible modules makes your code reusable, which is useful for endless reasons (refactoring comes to mind)
- Design using services: this ties into the previous tip, but, again, helps to create abstract pieces of code that can be used in any number of circumstances.

Tweet Summary:
Understand what you program the first time; have great tests in place before you refactor; analyze your algorithms.

Tips:
- Don't program by coincidence: this is so easy to do, especially with all the magic that comes bundled in Rails and Ruby. Avoiding this helps you to solve errors and extend your knowledge into other languages and domains.
- Refactor early, refactor often: do it now, or else it becomes a big ugly monster that you'll never tackle. Make good code, and keep making it better - this is a good practice to stick to.

Tweet Summary:
Dig for your requirements to eliminate amibiguity later; become the user to write the best application for them.

Tips:
- Don't gather requirements, dig for them: this was emphasized in the last project. If you're digging for the reqs, you'll inevitably end up understanding the application-to-be-built much better.
- Work with a user to think like a user: otherwise you're building for some mythical creature, and not putting any passion into the final product.

Tweet Summary:
At some point, you have to release your app. So, do the right work and do it once.

Tips:
- Test your tests: this is important because it's easy to write tests that don't actually test anything at all. Testing the tests makes sure that as the application evolves, you're catching every error as soon as it appears.
- Gently exceed user expectations: this is key to wow'ing the people who are consuming your app. If you do somethin great they didn't expect, their perception changes of the entire application. So, just gently exceed the expectations and you'll be met with enormous rewards.
