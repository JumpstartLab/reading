### Chapter 1

Take responsibility for your code. It doesn't need to be perfect, it needs to be good enough. Stay flexible, keep learning, and communicate.

* Broken windows -- don't let bad designs, decisions, or code into your application, because once it's there, adding more becomes acceptable.

* Programming skills are expiring assets. Learn new and diverse languages and technologies so that your knowledge never becomes out of date.


### Chapter 2

Code should be DRY and orthogonal so that changes can be implemented easily. Tracer bullets provide immediate feedback on direction.

* Constant communication reduces interdeveloper duplication, but should not be necessary if code is orthogonal, seems contradictory.

* Global data and singleton objects are not orthogonal; they make parts of your code too linked to one another. Refactor to eliminate them.


### Chapter 3

Learning to use tools such as the shell, power text editors, debuggers, and source control make you more productive and efficient.

* Text editors should be configurable, extensible, and programmable. You need to learn the ins and outs to cut keystrokes & not use the mouse.

* Use source control not just for code but also for other files such as documentation, phone numbers, memos, procedures and scripts.


### Chapter 4

There is no such thing as perfect software. Acknowledge this and prepare for imperfections by checking for bugs along the way.

* Catch errors and stop the program as quickly as possible. Code doing the wrong thing is much more dangerous than code that's not running.

* Assertions and error checking are not the same. Assertions should only be used when the thing you are checking for should never happen.
