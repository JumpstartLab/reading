# Chapter 1
  * Summary: Pragmatic programming is about more than writing the code itself. It is also about a the way that you think and how you conduct yourself.
  * Tip 4: Don't Live with Broken Windows - It is always easy to say "I'll fix it later." Unfortunately, this line of thinking usually leads to untenable software.
  * Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio - Software as a craft changes rapidly. Either make the investment to stay on the cutting edge, or take the risk         that your skills will become obsolete.
# Chapter 2
  * Summary: It isn't enough to write code that works. On top of that, you need to make sure to implement your code in a pragmatic manner.
  * Tip 13: Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things - By maintaining a high degree of orthoganality in your application, you can promote reuse and dramatically decrease your maintenance time.
  * Tip 14: There Are No Final Decisions - Build flexible applications expecting change, because those changes are inevitable.
# Chapter 3
  * Summary: As is true for any craftsman, a programmer must choose his tools carefully and then master them.
  * Tip 22: Use a Single Editor Well - Instead of becoming a jack of all trades, master of none, focus on becoming blazingly fast with one editor.
  * Tip 28: Learn a Text Manipulation Language - Many otherwise cumbersome tasks can be done in a few commands in the terminal, as long as you know what is possible.
# Chapter 4
  * Summary: Understand that no software, including your own, will be perfect. Practice defensive programming.
  * Tip 32: Crash Early - While exception handling may be beneficial for user experience, if you let you app crash early, you'll avoid doing further damage and be better able to isolate the issue.
  * Tip 35: Finish What You Start - Each area of your app should be responsible for what it creates, by also destroying it. Don't create coupled situations by spreading responsibilities around.
