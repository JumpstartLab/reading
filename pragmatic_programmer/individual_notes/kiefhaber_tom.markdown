#Prag Prog#

###Chapter 1###
Summary tweet: Know who your software is for, who you need on board to get it made, speak to them how they want to be spoken to.

Tip 1: Don't live with broken windows.  If it's broke, fix it. Slippery slope to the code ghetto if you don't.

Tip 2: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio.  Example of not: my brain.  Example of doing it: Charles.  I know barely one langauge, he knows all the languages.

###Chapter 2###
Summary tweet: Keep things clean and keep them so you can slot in new implementations of different parts of your software.

Tip 1: Make it easy to reuse.  If you can pick up a tool and use it, you will.  Otherwise everyone will be busy building new tools to do the same thing.

Tip 2: There are no final decisions.  Get your orthogonality on! Fractalize your shit.

###Chapter 3###
Summary tweet: Make your life easier by knowing your tools well and minimizing manual labor.

Tip 1: Use one editor well. Save time and brain bandwidth by keeping it simple.

Tip 2: Always use source code control.  Become a Git Master.  If you don't, you will never be able to keep track or back up.

###Chapter 4###
Summary tweet: Errors will happen, make your software accommodate for them.

Tip 1: You can't write perfect software.  Just make it as good as you can and strive for perfection, realizing you will never get there.

Tip 2: If it can't happen, use assertions to ensuer it won't.  Be authoritative in your testing to say that things will or will not happen.  Shoulds are too weak.


###Chapter 5###
Summary tweet: Write less code with less dependencies on other parts of code.  Good fences make great neighbors.

Tip 1: Minize coupling between modules.  One thing does one thing and talks to few other things.

Tip 2: Put abstractions in code, details in metadata.  Makes it so you can deal with information at a high level and then sub out how you get your data when you change routes in the future.


###Chapter 7###
Summary tweet: Understand why your code works, not just that it works.

Tip 1: Don't program by coincidence.  If you go too far without checking progress and status, you will be boiled like a frog.

Tip 2: Refactor early, refactor often.  Always be on the lookout for when you can simplify, decomplicate and/or untangle code.  Do it then, or make sure that people know it will be done in the future.


###Chapter 7###
Summary tweet: Start off on the right foot.  Set some ground rules, and you won't be caught in the predicament of making shit up as you go along.

Tip 1: Work with a user to think like a user.  Establish expectations up front and work towards them as end goals.

Tip 2: Don't think outside the box, think outside the bun.  GONG!  JK. Always consider all possibilities and then go from there.  What seems dumb upfront, might be the best solution.  Like a cheezy gordita crunch wrap supreme.


###Chapter 8###
Summary tweet: Everyone hates testing and documentation, but they are necessary evils unless you have a perfect memory and nobody else will ever touch your code.

Tip 1: Organize around functionality, not job functions.  Group things that make sense for how things work.  Look at what code you'll be touching and group projects into things that don't really cross.

Tip 2: Coding ain't done until all the tests run.  Make your tests test the right things, and if they all pass, you'll be golden.  If they don't really test anything of importance, it's worthless.
