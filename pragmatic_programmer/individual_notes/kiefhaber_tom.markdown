#Prag Prog#

###Chapter 1###
Summary tweet: Know who your software is for, who you need on board to get it made, speak to them how they want to be spoken to.

Tip 1: Don't live with broken windows.  If it's broke, fix it. Slippery slope to the code ghetto if you don't.

Tip 2: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio.  Example of not: my brain.  Example of doing it: Charles.  I know barely one langauge, he knows all the languages.

###Chapter 2###
Summary tweet: Keep things clean and keep them so you can slot in new implementations of different parts of your software.

Tip 1: Make it easy to reuse.  If you can pick up a tool and use it, you will.  Otherwise everyone will be busy building new tools to do the same thing.

Tip 2: There are no final decisions.  Get your orthogonality on! Fractalize your shit.

###Chapter 3###
Summary tweet: Make your life easier by knowing your tools well and minimizing manual labor.

Tip 1: Use one editor well. Save time and brain bandwidth by keeping it simple.

Tip 2: Always use source code control.  Become a Git Master.  If you don't, you will never be able to keep track or back up.

###Chapter 4###
Summary tweet: Errors will happen, make your software accommodate for them.

Tip 1: You can't write perfect software.  Just make it as good as you can and strive for perfection, realizing you will never get there.

Tip 2: If it can't happen, use assertions to ensuer it won't.  Be authoritative in your testing to say that things will or will not happen.  Shoulds are too weak.
