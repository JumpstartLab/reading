###Chapter 1

He discusses the importance of taking responsibility, cleaning simple repairs in code, knowing when to stop, and keeping up with a knowledge portfolio (reading, etc.)

**Tip 1: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio - I think career development is always important, so the suggestions he gave (attending classes, reading one technical and one non-technical book, etc.) were important

**Tip 2: It's both what you say and the way you say it - I especially liked the when part of it because I think people forget about context and focus only on content.

###Chapter 2
He discusses the processes for decision making, prototyping, and debugging

**Tip 1: Make it Easy to Reuse - I think this is just because of SonOfStoreEngine and having to use someone else's code.

**Tip 2: There are no final decisions - I have a hard time letting go of code that I've worked on because I think my way is the only way to go and don't want to go back again.


###Chapter 3
He discusses the tools needed to be a good programmer, including text editors, control systems, and command shells.

**Tip 1: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame - It really hasn't happened in HungryAcademy, but I've seen this happen in other departments, so I think it's good to reemphasize that the solution is the most important.

**Tip 2: Don't Panic When Debugging - I think Jeff said it best that the way to be a programmer is to be calm and relaxed. Bugs are inevitable, so just trying to think through in a calmly matter seems most important.

###Chapter 4
He discusses design by contract and how to use assertions for enforcing the method contracts.

**Tip 1: Crash Early - Again, I have a hard time letting go of code if I've gone too far, and by this point, the program can be terrible, so I need to go full force early and see if it's even worth going down that path.

**Tip 2: Design with Contracts - After dealing with contracts on a daily basis with the production team, following what is in writing prevents hassle on both ends of the group.

###Chapter 5
While coding, make sure to use metadata, use blackboards, and the MVC.

**Tip 1: Always Design for Concurrency
After the checkpoint for our last project, I realize it's important to make sure that all users/PMs/etc are on the same page, so make sure we design for all users, not just assumptions.

**Tip 2: Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata
I think this just gives a better picture of making sure that things are done on the overall level, and not picking one specific problem.

###Chapter 6
While coding, make sure to not get comfortable with testing and overlook some aspects.

**Tip 1: Refactor Early, Refactor Often
I have a hard time just refactoring after I realize that something works, then when I get too far, I have a hard time refactoring because I need to make future code fit with the old, bad code.

**Tip 2: Design to Test
With our time constraint, it is tempting to just start coding, but I do like testing since it gives structure to our day and gives verification that the code is working properly.

###Chapter 7
Before starting a project, it is important to make sure you have all requirements and make sure everything is ready before you start.

**Tip 1: Work with a User to Think Like a User
It's always good to get the insight of the end user because I think I just think for myself, so the UX could be terrible for the rest of the population.

**Tip 2: Start When You're Ready
With HA, I feel like we are just pushed for time, but I really think that I should always just take a step back first and realize what the overall problem we are trying to solve.

###Chapter 8
When working in a group, it is necessary to delegate responsibilites, automate everything, and manage customer's expectations.

**Tip 1: Find Bugs Once 
It's important to not waste time and redo the same tests over and over again, so finding one bug and solving it correctly will help int he long run.

**Tip 2: 
Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run
Just reemphasizing the importance of testing.
