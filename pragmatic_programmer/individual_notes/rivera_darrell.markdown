###Chapter 1

He discusses the importance of taking responsibility, cleaning simple repairs in code, knowing when to stop, and keeping up with a knowledge portfolio (reading, etc.)

**Tip 1: Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio - I think career development is always important, so the suggestions he gave (attending classes, reading one technical and one non-technical book, etc.) were important

**Tip 2: It's both what you say and the way you say it - I especially liked the when part of it because I think people forget about context and focus only on content.

###Chapter 2
He discusses the processes for decision making, prototyping, and debugging

**Tip 1: Make it Easy to Reuse - I think this is just because of SonOfStoreEngine and having to use someone else's code.

**Tip 2: There are no final decisions - I have a hard time letting go of code that I've worked on because I think my way is the only way to go and don't want to go back again.


###Chapter 3
He discusses the tools needed to be a good programmer, including text editors, control systems, and command shells.

**Tip 1: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame - It really hasn't happened in HungryAcademy, but I've seen this happen in other departments, so I think it's good to reemphasize that the solution is the most important.

**Tip 2: Don't Panic When Debugging - I think Jeff said it best that the way to be a programmer is to be calm and relaxed. Bugs are inevitable, so just trying to think through in a calmly matter seems most important.

###Chapter 4
He discusses design by contract and how to use assertions for enforcing the method contracts.

**Tip 1: Crash Early - Again, I have a hard time letting go of code if I've gone too far, and by this point, the program can be terrible, so I need to go full force early and see if it's even worth going down that path.

**Tip 2: Design with Contracts - After dealing with contracts on a daily basis with the production team, following what is in writing prevents hassle on both ends of the group.
