Chapter 01
==========

Take responsibility for your work, think, clearly communicate. Boil
frogs.

Critical thinking skills and communication are great points. It's nice
when people don't suck at both.


Chapter 02
==========

Understand the model, keep things dry, prototype things.

Domain languages are interesting.


Chapter 03
==========

Know your tools, and know them well.

Some of the thoughts on debugging are interesting. Visualizing the
debugger diagram could be useful.


Chapter 04
==========

Don't go crazy with exceptions, assert invariants explicitly.

DBC and explicitly stating invariants sounds like a mighty good idea.
