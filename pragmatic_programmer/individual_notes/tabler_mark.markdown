Ch1: The context of your work is as important as the work itself.
Tip:3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
       You were hired to make code, not explain why you didn't make code.

Tip:4. Don't Live With Broken Windows
       Code degenerates in quality to match the worst thing in it; this is why we can't have nice things (unless you're meticulous).

Ch2: The practice of software design is a different art from its theory, and you cannot neglect either.
Tip:11: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
        This isn't about being efficient, this is defensive programming. Repetition brings bugs, not just more typing.

Tip:15: Use Tracer Bullets to Find Your Target
        Iterate quickly, get user feedback often, and walk your shots until you're delivering someone's dream software.

Ch3: Your dev environment is the only tool you get - make it an excellent one.
Tip:20. Keep Knowledge In Plain Text
        Your data should ideally be human-understandable without special technology or system knowledge.

Tip:25. Don't Panic
        There is always a reason your software fails, and that reason can always be found. Be methodical, not frantic.

Ch4: Instead of making sure nothing ever goes wrong, write software that handles things going wrong.
Tip:30. You can't write perfect software
        You will never be above errors or bugs. Accept that they are part of the work flow and write graceful handling of these inevitabilities.

Tip:32. Crash Early
        A program that is active and malfunctioning under the radar is far more dangerous that one that is halted or is failing in an obvious way.



## Chapter 5
Your software should be as abstract as possible for maximum flexibility.

40. Desgin Using Services
Your method for parsing database indices should be a method for parsing database indices, not a method for parsing database indices for application X.

41. Always Design for Concurrency
Two methods should not be made temporally dependent unless their functions are actually temporally dependent.

## Chapter 6
There's the actual code writing, then there's everything that goes around the code writing; master both.

45. Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms
If you nest loops, you should feel in your bones that there is a cost to that and think about how to avoid that cost.

49. Test Your Software or your Users Will
Your code will either expose its rough edges in your dev lab or in production, and you get to choose which.

## Chapter 7
If writing software is like painting, then getting your project assembled correctly is like stretching & priming your canvas.

52. Work with a User to Think Like a User
In order to help a user write their requirements list, walk a mile in their shoes and see what your requirements list is.

55. Don't Think Outside The Box: Find The Box
Part of finding "the simplest thing that could possibly work" is never having to hear "I never said you couldn't [xyz]."

## Chapter 8
Everything you just read applies to code that you can't comfortably write in a month, too.

65. Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage
Master the art of asking important "What happens when" questions, and write tests to answer them.

70. Sign Your Work
Software development is a meritocracy. Your career is as good as your reputation. Build & protect it with awesome code, and put your name on what you do.
