Ch1: The context of your work is as important as the work itself.
Tip:3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
       You were hired to make code, not explain why you didn't make code.

Tip:4. Don't Live With Broken Windows
       Code degenerates in quality to match the worst thing in it; this is why we can't have nice things (unless you're meticulous).

Ch2: The practice of software design is a different art from its theory, and you cannot neglect either.
Tip:11: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
        This isn't about being efficient, this is defensive programming. Repetition brings bugs, not just more typing.

Tip:15: Use Tracer Bullets to Find Your Target
        Iterate quickly, get user feedback often, and walk your shots until you're delivering someone's dream software.

Ch3: Your dev environment is the only tool you get - make it an excellent one.
Tip:20. Keep Knowledge In Plain Text
        Your data should ideally be human-understandable without special technology or system knowledge.

Tip:25. Don't Panic
        There is always a reason your software fails, and that reason can always be found. Be methodical, not frantic.

Ch4: Instead of making sure nothing ever goes wrong, write software that handles things going wrong.
Tip:30. You can't write perfect software
        You will never be above errors or bugs. Accept that they are part of the work flow and write graceful handling of these inevitabilities.

Tip:32. Crash Early
        A program that is active and malfunctioning under the radar is far more dangerous that one that is halted or is failing in an obvious way.
