# Andrew's Pragmatic Programmer Notes
## Ch 1
  * Learn what people want, make products products that they want, and present it to them in such a way. Have a good balance of knowledge.
  * Tips
    * Listen to people. You don't always know what they want, and they will surprise you if you listen. Plus you'll get better buy-in from them.
    * Present your products well. Don't make your work look bad by not taking the time to prepare the presentation.

## Ch 2
  * Write smart code that anticipates change and potential time-pressured fixes. Estimate in such a way that you don't force bad code. 
  * Tips
    * Bad documentation is worse than none. Write code that doesn't need documentation because when you are rushing you'll neglect it.
    * Write shy code. Only give out to other parts of the code base what you absolutely have to.

## Ch 3
  * Tips to write smarter code so that you can develop faster. Learn your common technologies really well, learn the command line.
  * Tips
    * Make sure not to write code that could go obsolete. Protect against potential changes in formats, etc.
    * Learn one text editor really well so you are very fast. Make sure it is a powerful editor too.

## Ch 4
  * No one writes perfect code, so build in code that makes sure that what you write does what it's supposed to do.
  * Tips
    * Write assertions, try/catch statements, etc to make sure that your code is doing what you think it always should do.
    * Don't couple methods. If a method starts something it should finish it. No global variables.
