# Pragmatic Programmer, Chapters 1-4 Summary
### - Travis Valentine

## Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

* Stay humble, take responsibility, and always be learning and improving your communication skills.
* My two favorite tips:
  * Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.
  * Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

## Chapter 2 - A Pragmatic Approach

* Design code to be independent, simple, and smart. Prototype. Look for ways to improve, and test.
* My two favorite tips:
  * A small body of code has low inertiaâ€”it is easy and quick to change.
  * Tracer development is consistent with the idea that a project is never finished: there will always be changes required and functions to add. It is an incremental approach.

## Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools

* Human-readable data is the best. GUIs are convenient but you miss out with them.
* My two favorite tips:
  * For anything you find yourself doing repeatedly, develop a set of macros (or equivalent) to handle it.
  * Embrace the fact that debugging is just problem solving, and attack it as such.

## Chapter 4 - Pragmatic Paranoia

* Code in defense against the mistakes you will make.
* My two favorite tips:
  * A correct program does no more and no less than it claims to do. Documenting and verifying that claim is the heart of Design by Contract.
  * The routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
