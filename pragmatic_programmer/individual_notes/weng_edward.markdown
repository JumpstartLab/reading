# Ed Weng - Pragmatic Programmer Ch. 1-4

## Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy
* Keep your code clean. Technical debt has a snowball effect where a little becomes a lot really quickly.
* Tips:
  * Invest in your knowledge portfolio. Technology changes all the time and very rapidly, so in order to keep up, you need to constantly be reading.
  * Be smart about presentation. Pick an opportune time to present someone with a good idea.

## Chapter 2 - A Pragmatic Approach
* There are right ways to code and wrong ways to code. By coding in the right way, you keep the maintenence of your code possible.
* Tips:
  * The less you code (code size), the easier it will be to change.
  * Don't repeat yourself (DRY). When it comes time to change your strucutre, there will be fewer pieces of your program that you will need to alter.

## Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools
* People who use an IDE should try using the shell and vice versa. There are advantages to both and great power and flexibility in the shell.
* Tips:
  * Don't get caught up in formats that will eventually change. Make your program flexible.
  * Debug your own code first in order to find bugs faster.

## Chapter 4 - Pragmatic Paranoia
* No software is ever perfect, but there are ways to minimize errors and their impact.
* Tips:
  * Refrain from using global variables and don't couple methods (don't use inter/intra module calls).
  * Use exceptions for exceptional cases, times where there is an immediate, nonlocal transfer of control.
