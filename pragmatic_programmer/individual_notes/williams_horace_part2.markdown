## Pragmatic Programmer Tweet Summaries

1. Chapter 5: Good (pragmatic) programmers will focus not just on
writing code that works but also on writing code that will be adaptable
in the future.

  * Tip #27: Use metaprogramming to program your programs; let your
    inherent laziness loose and avoid writing repetitive code!

  * Tip #30: Having a system-wide _blackboard_ can be a good way to let
    your components talk to each other without coupling them too
tightly.

2. Chapter 6: Coding is an ongoing extension of the design process that
   involves constant evaluations and judgement calls. Make intentional
choices even at the smallest level to keep your project from sliding
into pitfalls.

  * Tip #34: "Testing is more cultural than technical; we can instill
    this testing culture in a project regardless of the language being
used."

  * Tip #35: Beware of evil wizards! Prag progs make their own decisions
    and don't use code they don't understand.

3. Chapter 7: While many people would like to project requirements to be
   gathered exhaustively at the outset, this rarely works out. Use
previously covered strategies like prototyping and user testing to get
ongoing feedback and manage expectations.

  * Tip #51: Taking requirements at face value will usually result in a
    shallow product; people don't actually want what they think they
want. Dig deeper to figure out their real problems and help them solve
them.

  * Tip #56: When you're feeling stuck or procrastinating, just start
    prototyping something. Even if you don't end up using it, it can
help you get out of the rut and start moving forward.

4. Chapter 8: Pods of Programmers Profit from Pragmatic Principles as
   well. Your pragmatic principles will only be effective if the whole
team employs them as well.

  * Tip #61: Be a programmer and automate repeatable things; (a la first
    day dev tools from livingsocial!) Things like Rubygems and Homebrew
set a good precedent for automating things like buildtools; follow this
precedent.

  * Tip #64: _Really_ test by appointing a "saboteur" to aggressively
    attack the weaknesses in your project; this will help you to avoid
the pitfall of "subconsciously protecting your weakspots."
