#Chapter 1  

Know what you want to say and who your audience is. Modify your style to reflect your audience. Engage and listen to your audience.

* It's both what you say and the way you say it: words don't matter as much as presentation style, body language, etc.

* Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio. You need to diversify to manage risk. 

#Chapter 2  

This chapter details tips and tricks for development, both theoretically and practically. 

* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. Have a single, clear, and authoritative place for each piece of knowledge in a system.

* Prototype to learn. Ignore correctness, completeness, style, and robustness. Prototype anything you're uncomfortable with or anything that is unproven to gain familiarity. 

#Chapter 3  

Invest in your toolbox to amplify your talent and be more productive. Start broad, and become focused with your tools over time.

* Use a single editor well. If you use a single editor, you won't have to stop to think to accomplish text manipulation - it'll just be muscle memory.

* Always use source code control. This will help you identify who worked on specific code, differences in code, and help you while bug tracking.

#Chapter 4  

No one writes perfect code, so use assertive programming and defensive measures to do your best. Perfect software doesn't exist.

* If it can't happen, use assertions to ensure it won't. Don't make assumptions that something can't happen - write code to check that it won't.

* Use exceptions for exceptional problems. Exceptions as normal process lose readability and maintainability and break the rule of encapsulation. 

#Chapter 5  

Have flexible code that's ready for the future. Write small amounts of reversible, decoupled code.

* Per the law of Demeter, minimize coupling between models. Reducing the size of response set reduces errors.

* Put abstractions in code, details in metadata. Program for the general case.

#Chapter 6  

Be thoughtful and proactive about your code. Consider speed and practice refactoring. 

* Refactor early, refactor often. Take care of problems while they're small.

* Don't user wizard code you don't understand. Wizards are good, but not when they're magical.

#Chapter 7  

Establish ground rules for your projects: approach them only when you're ready, but don't over-specify. 

* Don't gather requirements - dig for them. Requirements are hard to find and are non-obvious. Do a thorough job of nailing them down.

* Abstractions live longer than details. Don't put details in your code because they'll inevitably change.

#Chapter 8  

Be proud of your software and always be comfortable putting your name on it. Test it well, communicate heavily with your team, and exceed your customers' expectations. 

* Gently exceed your users' expectations. Don't work too closely with them or you'll only provide exactly what they want. Surprise and delight them. 

* Sign your work. You always own your code.
