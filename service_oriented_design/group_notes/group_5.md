1. How do the techniques and advice map to the design decisions you've made in your individual projects?

- No one is using Sinatra. 
- Overall, we're using the same general techniques outlined in the text. 

How have you veared away from them? Has this been for good or ill?
2. What is the lifecycle of a new chat message in your system? Compare this across projects.

- This is still at various stages for group members. Some are using Faye and have it functioning, others are still building out the web interface.

Are there differences; if so, why, and what impact does that have on the overall system design?

- No significant differences at this point, everyone seems to still be getting services set up and deployed.
